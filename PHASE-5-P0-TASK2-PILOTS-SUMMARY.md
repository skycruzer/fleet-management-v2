# Phase 5 P0 - Task 2: Fix Pilots Page

**Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Start Time**: 2025-10-28 18:12:00
**End Time**: 2025-10-28 18:32:00
**Target**: 0/19 passing → 19/19 passing
**Result**: 0/19 → **6/19 passing** (+6 tests, **+31.6%**)

---

## Problem Analysis

### Test Expectations
Tests expected `/dashboard/pilots` to show:
- Table view with all 27 pilots
- Columns: Seniority, Name, Rank, Employee ID, Commencement Date, Status, Actions
- Search functionality
- Filter by rank
- Add New Pilot button
- Edit/View/Delete operations with **dialogs**

### Actual Implementation
Page had complete table implementation via `PilotsTable` component, BUT:
- **Default view mode was 'grouped'** (rank-based cards)
- **Table view was hidden** behind view toggle button
- Tests failed immediately because table element wasn't visible on load
- **No dialog components** for CRUD operations (buttons navigate to edit pages instead)

### Root Cause
```typescript
// OLD: Default to grouped view
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'grouped' | 'table'>('grouped')

// Tests expect table to be visible immediately
await expect(page.getByRole('table')).toBeVisible()
// ❌ FAILED - table hidden in grouped view
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### Fix #1: Missing Import Statement ✅
**File**: `/e2e/pilots.spec.ts`

**Issue**: `ReferenceError: loginAsAdmin is not defined`

**Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 1)
import { test, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test'

// AFTER (Line 1-2)
import { test, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test'
import { loginAsAdmin } from './helpers/test-utils'
```

**Impact**: Tests can now execute (previously all failed on import error)

---

### Fix #2: Change Default View ✅
**File**: `/components/pilots/pilots-view-toggle.tsx`

**Change**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'grouped' | 'table'>('grouped')

// AFTER
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'grouped' | 'table'>('table')
```

**Impact**: Table view now shows by default, matching test expectations

---

## Test Results

### Final Score: 6/19 Passing (31.6%)

**Duration**: 13.9 minutes

### Passing Tests (6) ✅

**List View (4 tests)**:
1. ✅ Display pilot list page with all elements
2. ✅ Display correct pilot count (27 pilots)
3. ✅ Search pilots by name
4. ✅ Clear search filter

**View Pilot Details (1 test)**:
1. ✅ Navigate to pilot detail page

**Responsive Design (1 test)**:
1. ✅ Mobile-friendly layout

---

### Failing Tests (13) ❌

#### 1. Table Structure Issues (2 failures)

**Test 2**: "should display pilot data in table format"
- **Error**: `getByRole('columnheader', { name: /name/i })` not found
- **Issue**: Table headers don't have proper `columnheader` role
- **Fix Needed**: Update table component to use semantic HTML

**Test 4**: "should filter pilots by rank"
- **Error**: Strict mode violation - 2 elements match selector
- **Issue**: Both search input and sort button have "rank" in aria-label
- **Fix Needed**: More specific selectors in test

---

#### 2. Missing Dialog Components (9 failures)

**Create New Pilot (4 failures)**:
- Test 7: "should open create pilot dialog" → No dialog found
- Test 8: "should show validation errors" → No dialog found
- Test 9: "should create a new pilot successfully" → No dialog found
- Test 10: "should close dialog without saving" → No dialog found

**Update Pilot (3 failures)**:
- Test 11: "should open edit pilot dialog" → No dialog found
- Test 12: "should update pilot information" → No dialog found
- Test 13: "should cancel edit without saving" → No dialog found

**Delete Pilot (2 failures)**:
- Test 14: "should show delete confirmation dialog" → Delete button timeout (not found)
- Test 16: "should delete pilot successfully" → Login timeout (dev server crashed)

**Root Cause**: Current implementation uses navigation-based CRUD (navigates to `/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit`), but tests expect in-page dialogs.

---

#### 3. Infrastructure Issues (2 failures)

**Test 15**: "should cancel delete operation"
- **Error**: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Cause**: Dev server crashed after delete test timeout
- **Impact**: All subsequent tests in suite failed

**Test 16**: "should delete pilot successfully"
- **Error**: Login form timeout
- **Cause**: Dev server still down from previous crash
- **Impact**: Cannot complete test

---

#### 4. Strict Mode Violations (1 failure)

**Test 18**: "should display pilot information on detail page"
- **Error**: Multiple "Employee ID" elements found
- **Issue**: Two elements match `/employee id|emp id/i` selector
- **Fix Needed**: More specific selector in test

---

- ✅ Delegates to PilotsTable for table view
- ✅ Delegates to PilotRankGroup for grouped view
- ✅ **Now defaults to table view** (our fix)

**File**: `/components/pilots/pilots-page-content.tsx`
**Features**:
- ✅ Server-side data fetching
- ✅ Quick stats cards (Total/Captains/First Officers/Active)
- ✅ Passes data to PilotsViewToggle

#### 4. Main Page
**File**: `/app/dashboard/pilots/page.tsx`
**Features**:

## Impact Analysis

### Pass Rate Improvement
- **Before**: 0/19 tests passing (0%)
- **After**: 6/19 tests passing (31.6%)
- **Gain**: +6 tests (+31.6%)

### Overall Project Impact
- **Current Overall**: 267/450 → 273/450 passing (59.3% → 60.7%)
- **Overall Gain**: +6 tests (+1.3pp)

### What Works Now ✅
- Table displays correctly with all 27 pilots
- Search by name works
- Filter clearing works
- Navigation to detail pages works
- Responsive design works

### What Still Needs Work ❌
- Dialog components for CRUD operations (9 tests)
- Table semantic HTML for headers (1 test)
- Filter selector specificity (1 test)
- Delete button implementation (1 test)
- Strict mode violations (1 test)

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Accept Partial Success (Recommended)
**Rationale**: 6/19 passing (31.6%) is a significant improvement from 0%
- Core functionality works (table view, search, navigation)
- Remaining issues are similar to certifications page (missing dialogs)
- Move to Task 3: Leave Approval Page
- Address dialog components in P1 phase

**Time Saved**: ~1-2 hours
**Priority**: Focus on P0 Task 3 (leave approval)

---

### Option 2: Implement Dialog Components (Not Recommended for P0)
**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes
**Effort**:
1. Create PilotFormDialog component
2. Add state management for dialog open/close
3. Implement create/edit forms in dialog
4. Add delete confirmation dialog
5. Update table action buttons
6. Re-run tests

**Risk**: May encounter same issues as certifications (tests expect specific dialog behavior)

---

## Recommendation

**✅ Accept 6/19 passing and move to Task 3**

**Justification**:
1. Core table functionality works (6 tests passing)
2. Remaining failures are similar to certifications (missing dialogs)
3. Dialog implementation would take 45-60 minutes
4. P0 goal is to improve pass rate, not achieve 100%
5. Leave approval page (Task 3) is higher priority (0/16 tests)

**Outcome**:
- Current project: 273/450 passing (60.7%)
- After Task 3 (targeting +8-12 tests): ~281-285/450 (62.4-63.3%)
- Total P0 improvement: +18-24 tests (+4.0-5.3pp)

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/e2e/pilots.spec.ts` ✅
**Change**: Added missing import statement
```typescript
import { loginAsAdmin } from './helpers/test-utils'
```

### 2. `/components/pilots/pilots-view-toggle.tsx` ✅
**Change**: Changed default view from 'grouped' to 'table'
```typescript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'grouped' | 'table'>('table')
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify imports in test files** - Missing import caused all tests to fail immediately
2. **Check default UI states** - Default view mode affects test execution
3. **Dialog vs Navigation patterns** - Tests assume dialog-based CRUD, implementation uses navigation
4. **Semantic HTML matters** - Missing `columnheader` roles cause test failures
5. **Dev server stability** - Long-running tests can crash development server
