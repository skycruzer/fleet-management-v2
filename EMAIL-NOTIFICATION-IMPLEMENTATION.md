# Email Notification System - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - Ready for testing with Resend API key
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## üìß Overview

The pilot portal now includes a comprehensive email notification system that automatically sends professionally designed emails to pilots when their registrations are approved or denied.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Email Service (`lib/services/pilot-email-service.ts`)

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Professional HTML email templates with aviation theme
- ‚úÖ Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
- ‚úÖ Configurable via environment variables
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation (approval/denial proceeds even if email fails)

**Functions**:
```typescript
sendRegistrationApprovalEmail(pilotData) // Sends approval notification
sendRegistrationDenialEmail(pilotData, denialReason?) // Sends denial notification
```

### 2. Approval Email Template

**Design Features**:
- ‚úàÔ∏è Aviation-themed header with app branding
- ‚úÖ Clear approval message with pilot's rank and name
- üìã Bullet list of portal features they can now access
- üîµ Prominent "Log in to Pilot Portal" call-to-action button
- üìù Login credentials reminder (email, employee ID)
- üìß Professional footer with copyright and automated message disclaimer

**What Pilots See**:
- Welcoming "Welcome Aboard, Captain Smith!" greeting
- List of features: Dashboard, Leave Requests, Flight Requests, Certifications, Notifications
- Direct login link button
- Their login email and employee ID for reference

### 3. Denial Email Template

**Design Features**:
- üî¥ Professional but empathetic denial notification
- üìù Optional denial reason display (if provided by admin)
- üí° "What's Next?" section with support contact info
- üìß Professional footer with support email link

**What Pilots See**:
- Respectful "Registration Status Update" message
- Clear explanation that registration wasn't approved
- Reason for denial (if admin provided one)
- Instructions to contact support if they have questions

### 4. Integrated into Approval Workflow

**Updated Files**:
- `app/dashboard/admin/pilot-registrations/actions.ts`

**Workflow**:
```
1. Admin clicks "Approve" or "Deny" button
2. System fetches pilot details from database
3. System updates registration status in database
4. System sends appropriate email notification
5. System logs email success/failure
6. System refreshes admin dashboard
7. Admin sees success message (includes email status)
```

**Error Handling**:
- If email fails, approval/denial still succeeds
- Error is logged to console for debugging
- Success message indicates if email was sent or not

---

## üîß Setup Requirements

### Required Environment Variables

Add these to `.env.local`:

```env
# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Fleet Management <noreply@yourdomain.com>
```

### How to Get Resend API Key

1. **Sign up for Resend**:
   - Visit: https://resend.com/signup
   - Create a free account (100 emails/day on free tier)

2. **Get API Key**:
   - Visit: https://resend.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)
   - Paste into `.env.local` as `RESEND_API_KEY`

3. **Configure Sending Domain** (for production):
   - Visit: https://resend.com/domains
   - Add your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Verify domain
   - Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use verified domain

### Testing Configuration (Development)

For development/testing, you can use:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

**Note**: `onboarding@resend.dev` only delivers to the email address associated with your Resend account.

## üß™ Testing the Email System

### Test Scenario 1: Approval Email

1. **Create a test registration**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/portal/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "first_name": "Test",
       "last_name": "Pilot",
       "email": "YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com",
       "password": "TestPass@123",
       "confirmPassword": "TestPass@123",
       "rank": "Captain",
       "employee_id": "TEST001"
     }'
   ```

2. **Navigate to admin dashboard**:
   - Go to `/dashboard/admin/pilot-registrations`
   - You should see the test registration in pending list

3. **Click "Approve" button**:
   - Registration should be approved
   - Check console logs for: `üìß Approval email sent successfully`
   - Check your email inbox for approval email

4. **Verify email received**:
   - Subject: "‚úÖ Your Pilot Portal Registration Has Been Approved"
   - Content: Professional HTML email with login button
   - Check that all details are correct (name, rank, login URL)

### Test Scenario 2: Denial Email

1. **Create another test registration** (same as above, different email)

2. **Navigate to admin dashboard**

3. **Click "Deny" button**:
   - Optionally, add a denial reason in the dialog
   - Registration should be denied
   - Check console logs for: `üìß Denial email sent successfully`
   - Check email inbox for denial notification

4. **Verify email received**:
   - Subject: "Pilot Portal Registration Update"
   - Content: Professional denial message with reason (if provided)
   - Includes support contact information

### Console Log Verification

Successful approval with email:
```
Approving registration: 6aa2b580-dcec-4988-bcde-77703ab1e30a
‚úÖ Registration approved successfully
‚úÖ Approval email sent to skycruzer@icloud.com
üìß Approval email sent successfully
```

Failed email (but successful approval):
```
Approving registration: 6aa2b580-dcec-4988-bcde-77703ab1e30a
‚úÖ Registration approved successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to send approval email: API key is invalid
```

---

## üìã Email Template Customization

### Updating Email Design

Edit `lib/services/pilot-email-service.ts`:

**Change colors**:
```typescript
// Primary blue: #0066cc
// Success green: #00aa00
// Danger red: #dc3545
// Warning yellow: #ffc107
```

**Change branding**:
```typescript
const EMAIL_CONFIG = {
  from: 'Your Airline <noreply@yourairline.com>',
  appUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,
  appName: 'Your Airline Pilot Portal',
}
```

**Update support email**:
```typescript
const supportEmail = 'support@yourairline.com'
```

### Adding New Email Types

To add more email notifications (e.g., password reset, leave approved):

1. Create new function in `pilot-email-service.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export async function sendPasswordResetEmail(pilotData, resetLink) {
     // Similar structure to existing functions
   }
   ```

2. Design HTML and text templates

3. Call from appropriate service/action

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

‚úÖ **Safe**:
- API key stored in environment variable (not committed to git)
- Emails sent server-side only (not exposed to client)
- No sensitive data in email content (no passwords, tokens)
- Graceful error handling (doesn't expose internal errors to client)

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Production**:
- [ ] Use verified sending domain (not `onboarding@resend.dev`)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent email spam
- [ ] Consider adding email verification flow
- [ ] Add unsubscribe mechanism for compliance
- [ ] Monitor Resend quota and billing
- [ ] Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records

---

## üìä Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Email Delivery Status

Resend Dashboard: https://resend.com/emails

**Metrics available**:
- Emails sent (count)
- Delivery rate (%)
- Bounce rate (%)
- Open rate (%) - if tracking enabled
- Click rate (%) - if tracking enabled

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "API key is invalid"
- **Fix**: Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local` is correct
- Check you copied the full key including `re_` prefix

**Issue**: "Email sent but not received"
- **Fix**: Check spam folder
- Verify recipient email is correct in database
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- If using `onboarding@resend.dev`, email must match Resend account

**Issue**: "Failed to send approval email: Forbidden"
- **Fix**: Verify sending domain is verified in Resend
- Or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing

**Issue**: Emails look broken in some email clients
- **Fix**: Email HTML uses inline styles for maximum compatibility
- Test in Litmus or Email on Acid for cross-client testing

## üìà Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] **Get Resend API key** (production account)
- [ ] **Add and verify custom domain** in Resend
- [ ] **Configure DNS records** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] **Update environment variables**:
  - [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` (production key)
  - [ ] `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (verified domain)
- [ ] **Test email delivery** with real addresses
- [ ] **Check spam score** (mail-tester.com)
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** (Resend webhooks)
- [ ] **Configure email analytics** (optional)
- [ ] **Add rate limiting** to registration endpoint
- [ ] **Review email content** for branding accuracy

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Email Verification Flow

**Purpose**: Verify pilot's email address before allowing registration

**Implementation**:
1. Send verification email with token after registration
2. Pilot clicks link to verify email
3. Only verified emails can be approved by admin

### Email Templates Library

**Purpose**: Reusable email components and layouts

**Implementation**:
1. Create `lib/email-templates/` directory
2. Extract common components (header, footer, button)
3. Use React Email (react.email) for better template management

### Email Preferences

**Purpose**: Let pilots control which notifications they receive

**Implementation**:
1. Add `email_preferences` JSONB column to `pilot_users`
2. Create settings page for pilots to toggle notifications
3. Check preferences before sending emails

### Email Queue System

**Purpose**: Handle email sending asynchronously with retries

**Implementation**:
1. Install Bull or BullMQ for job queue
2. Queue email jobs instead of sending immediately
3. Retry failed emails automatically
4. Monitor queue health
