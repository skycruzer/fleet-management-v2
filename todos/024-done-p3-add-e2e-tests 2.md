## Test Coverage Summary

Total test files: 4 core + 1 utility + 1 example = 6 files
Total test cases: 50+ comprehensive E2E tests

**Coverage by Feature:**
- Authentication: 8 tests
- Pilot Management: 12 tests
- Certifications: 14 tests
- Dashboard: 16 tests

**Browser Coverage:**
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile: iPhone, Android

## Implementation Details

**Effort**: Completed in single session (estimated 2-3 weeks reduced to immediate implementation)

**Test Patterns Used:**
- Page Object Model principles
- Reusable helper functions
- Semantic selectors (role-based)
- Explicit waits (no arbitrary timeouts)
- Conditional element handling
- Mobile-responsive testing

**Best Practices Applied:**
- Test isolation (no shared state)
- Descriptive test names
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Error handling for optional elements
- Environment variable configuration
- CI/CD integration with security controls

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/auth.spec.ts

# Run in debug mode
npm run test:debug
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Manual workflow dispatch

Required GitHub secrets:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `TEST_USER_EMAIL`
- `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`

## Notes

- Reference implementation exceeded original scope from air-niugini-pms
- Added comprehensive test utilities for maintainability
- Included mobile responsive testing
- Security-compliant CI workflow (no command injection vulnerabilities)
- Complete documentation for team onboarding
- Performance monitoring included
- All acceptance criteria met and exceeded

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - Ready for production use
