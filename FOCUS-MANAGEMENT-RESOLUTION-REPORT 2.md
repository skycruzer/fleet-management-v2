## Changes Made

### 1. Core Infrastructure - Focus Management Hooks

**File**: `/lib/hooks/use-focus-management.ts` (NEW - 236 lines)

  - Provides utilities: `focusFirst()`, `focusElement()`, `returnFocus()`, `getFocusableElements()`
  - Automatically stores previous focus and restores on unmount

- **`useFormFocusManagement`**: Specialized hook for forms
  - Auto-focuses first field on mount
  - Provides refs for success/error messages

  - `isFirst` prop triggers auto-focus

### 6. Route Change Focus Management

**File**: `/components/ui/route-change-focus.tsx` (NEW - 97 lines)

  {children}
</main>
```

### 9. Documentation

**File**: `/docs/FOCUS-MANAGEMENT.md` (NEW - 450+ lines)

Comprehensive implementation guide including:
- Overview of all components and utilities
- Usage examples and patterns
- Implementation checklist
- Testing procedures (keyboard and screen reader)
- WCAG compliance details
- Common patterns and troubleshooting

**File**: `/lib/hooks/README.md` (MODIFIED)

Updated to document new focus management hooks.

- [ ] NVDA (Windows): Verify form error announcements
- [ ] Test skip link announcements
- [ ] Test success/error message announcements

### Browser Testing

## Usage Examples

### Using the Modal Component

```tsx
import { Modal, ModalFooter } from '@/components/ui/modal'

<Modal
  open={isOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
  title="Confirm Action"
  closeOnEscape={true}
>
  <p>Are you sure?</p>
  <ModalFooter>
    <Button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>Cancel</Button>
    <Button onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm</Button>
  </ModalFooter>
</Modal>
```

### Using Auto-Focus in Forms

```tsx
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input'

<form>
  <Input
    autoFocusFirst={true}  // First field auto-focuses
    name="firstName"
  />
  <Input name="lastName" />
</form>
```

### Using Success Messages

```tsx
import { SuccessMessage } from '@/components/ui/accessible-form'

{success && (
  <SuccessMessage autoFocus>
    Your request was submitted successfully!
  </SuccessMessage>
)}
```
