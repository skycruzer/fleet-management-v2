## üß™ Testing Required

### Test 1: Authentication Separation (End-to-End)

**Objective**: Verify pilots cannot access admin dashboard and vice versa

**Test Cases**:
1. **Pilot tries to access admin dashboard**
   - Action: Login as pilot ‚Üí Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Expected: Redirect to `/portal/dashboard` with toast: "You need admin or fleet manager access"
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

2. **Admin tries to access pilot portal**
   - Action: Login as admin ‚Üí Navigate to `/portal/dashboard`
   - Expected: Redirect to `/auth/login` (not authorized as pilot)
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

3. **Unauthenticated user access**
   - Action: Navigate to `/portal/dashboard` (no login)
   - Expected: Redirect to `/portal/login?redirect=/portal/dashboard`
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

4. **Dual-role user (pilot + admin)**
   - Action: User in both `pilot_users` and `an_users` tables
   - Expected: Can access both portals with appropriate logins
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING (need to create test user)

---

### Test 2: Leave Request Workflow (Pilot Portal)

**Objective**: Verify pilots can submit, view, and cancel leave requests

**Test Cases**:
1. **Submit new leave request**
   - Action: Login as approved pilot ‚Üí Submit leave request
   - Expected: Request created with status PENDING, visible in portal
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

2. **View existing leave requests**
   - Action: Login as pilot ‚Üí Navigate to leave requests
   - Expected: See all own requests, sorted by date
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

3. **Cancel pending leave request**
   - Action: Select PENDING request ‚Üí Click cancel
   - Expected: Request deleted successfully
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

4. **Cannot cancel approved/denied requests**
   - Action: Try to cancel non-PENDING request
   - Expected: Error message, request not deleted
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

---

### Test 3: Flight Request Workflow (Pilot Portal)

**Objective**: Verify pilots can submit and manage flight requests

**Test Cases**:
1. **Submit flight request**
   - Action: Submit new flight request (ADDITIONAL_FLIGHT type)
   - Expected: Request created, status PENDING
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

2. **View flight request history**
   - Action: Navigate to flight requests page
   - Expected: All own requests displayed
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

3. **Cancel pending flight request**
   - Action: Cancel PENDING flight request
   - Expected: Request deleted
   - Status: ‚è≥ PENDING

## üö® Known Issues (To Fix During Testing)

### Database Issues
1. **RLS Policy Violations** - `pilot_users` table
   - Error: `new row violates row-level security policy`
   - Impact: Pilot registration failing
   - Fix Required: Update RLS policies for new auth structure

2. **Password Reset Tokens RLS**
   - Error: RLS policy violation on insert
   - Impact: Password reset flow broken
   - Fix Required: Add RLS policy for password reset tokens

3. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - Missing relationship: `pilots ‚Üî pilot_users`
   - Missing relationship: `leave_bids ‚Üî leave_bid_options`
   - Impact: Some queries failing
   - Fix Required: Database schema updates or query fixes

### Authentication Issues
1. **Supabase Auth Connectivity**
   - Warning: "Bypassing Supabase Auth due to connectivity issues"
   - Impact: Falling back to direct registration
   - Status: May be temporary network issue

2. **Email Integration**
   - Error: Resend API key invalid
   - Impact: Approval emails not sending
   - Fix Required: Update Resend API key in environment variables

4. **Document Test Results**
   - Record actual vs expected outcomes
   - Note any errors or issues
   - Update this document with results

### Deployment (BLOCKED)
- ‚õî User requested: "do not deploy yet"
- ‚è≥ Waiting for: Testing completion
- üìç Deploy target: Vercel production environment

## üìù Notes

- **Hot Reload Issue**: `portal-toast-handler.tsx` module error on initial compile
  - File exists at correct path
  - Should resolve on next compilation or server restart

- **Middleware Migration**: Successfully moved from `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16)

- **Authentication Pattern**: All services now use simplified `getCurrentPilot()` helper
  - Returns: `PilotUser | null`
  - Previous: `ServiceResponse<PilotUser>`
  - Benefits: Cleaner code, better type safety
