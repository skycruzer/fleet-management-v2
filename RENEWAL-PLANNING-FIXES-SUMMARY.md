# Renewal Planning Fixes - Quick Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. PDF Export Bug
**Problem**: PDF export was using `today` instead of the selected year parameter.

**Fix**: Now correctly filters roster periods by the specified year.

**Impact**: PDFs now show the correct year's data instead of "future from today".

---

### 2. Missing 'Planned' Status
**Problem**: Renewal queries only included 'confirmed' and 'pending' statuses.

**Fix**: Now includes all three statuses: `['confirmed', 'pending', 'planned']`

**Impact**: All renewal plans are now included in PDFs and emails.

---

### 3. No Data Validation
**Problem**: No checks before generating PDFs or sending emails.

**Fix**: Added validation for:
- Year parameter (must be 2020-2100)
- Roster periods existence
- Renewal data existence
- Empty data checks

**Impact**: Users get helpful error messages instead of crashes.

---

### 4. Email Not Implemented
**Problem**: Email functionality was just a placeholder.

**Fix**: Complete implementation with:
- Resend API integration
- Professional HTML email template
- Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Audit logging for sent emails
- Toast notifications for user feedback

**Impact**: Rostering team can now receive automated renewal reports.

---

### 5. No Loading States
**Problem**: No feedback during async operations.

**Fix**: Added:
- Loading spinner during email send
- Disabled buttons when no data exists
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Empty state alerts

**Impact**: Better user experience with clear feedback.
