Type error: Conversion of type '{ pilot_name: string; employee_id: any; pilot_role: any; reviewer_name: string | null; approved_by: string | null; created_at: string | null; days_count: number; end_date: string; id: string; ... 18 more ...; reviewer: { ...; } | null; }' to type 'LeaveRequest' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Types of property 'pilots' are incompatible.
    Type 'SelectQueryError<"Could not embed because more than one relationship was found for 'pilots' and 'leave_requests' you need to hint the column with pilots!<columnName> ?">' is not comparable to type '{ first_name: string; middle_name?: string | null | undefined; last_name: string; employee_id: string; role: "Captain" | "First Officer"; } | null | undefined'.
