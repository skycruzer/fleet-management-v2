# 🎯 Pilot Rank Update Issue - RESOLVED

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Issue**: Pilot rank changes not persisting when updating from Captain to First Officer
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Issue Reported**: User reported that changing a pilot's rank from Captain to First Officer was not persisting in the database.

**Root Cause**: Form validation was failing silently due to captain qualifications validation rule. When changing a Captain (who has captain_qualifications) to First Officer, the Zod validation schema rejected the submission because "Captain qualifications can only be assigned to Captains".

**Solution**: Added a React useEffect hook to automatically clear `captain_qualifications` when the role is changed to "First Officer".

**Result**: ✅ Rank updates now work correctly and persist to the database.

## 🔍 Investigation Process

### Step 1: Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive console logging to:
- **API Route** (`/app/api/pilots/[id]/route.ts`) - Lines 72-132
- **Service Layer** (`/lib/services/pilot-service.ts`) - Lines 664-741

This logging tracks the complete data flow from form submission to database update.

### Step 2: Created Automated Tests
Created multiple Puppeteer test scripts to simulate user interaction:
- `test-manual-click.js` - Test dropdown behavior
- `test-complete-flow.js` - End-to-end test with persistence verification

### Step 3: Identified the Problem
Through testing, discovered:
1. ✅ Dropdown was changing correctly
2. ❌ Form submission was NOT calling the API (no PUT requests in logs)
3. ⚠️ No navigation occurred after clicking "Update Pilot"

This indicated **form validation was silently failing**.

### Step 4: Found Root Cause
Reviewed validation schema (`/lib/validations/pilot-validation.ts` lines 258-268):

```typescript
.refine(
  (data) => {
    if (data.captain_qualifications && data.captain_qualifications.length > 0 && data.role) {
      return data.role === 'Captain'  // ❌ This was failing!
    }
    return true
  },
  {
    message: 'Captain qualifications can only be assigned to Captains',
    path: ['captain_qualifications'],
  }
)
```

**The Problem**: When a Captain (with qualifications like line_captain, training_captain, examiner) is changed to First Officer, the form still contains `captain_qualifications` array. The validation fails because First Officers cannot have captain qualifications, preventing form submission.

## ✅ The Fix

**File**: `/app/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
**Lines Added**: 65, 73-78

### Added `setValue` to useForm hook:
```typescript
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  watch,
  reset,
  setValue,  // ← Added this
  formState: { errors },
} = useForm<PilotFormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(PilotUpdateSchema),
})
```

### Added useEffect to clear captain qualifications:
```typescript
// Clear captain qualifications when role changes to First Officer
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedRole === 'First Officer') {
    setValue('captain_qualifications', [])
  }
}, [selectedRole, setValue])
```

**What this does**: Whenever the user changes the rank dropdown to "First Officer", React Hook Form automatically clears the `captain_qualifications` field, allowing the validation to pass.

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Test Results (Before Fix):
```
Original Rank:           Captain
Intended New Rank:       First Officer
Rank After Submit:       Captain           ← ❌ Not updated
Rank On Detail Page:     Captain           ← ❌ Not persisted
Result:                  ❌ FAILURE
```

### Test Results (After Fix):
```
Original Rank:           Captain
Intended New Rank:       First Officer
Rank After Submit:       First Officer     ← ✅ Updated!
Rank On Detail Page:     First Officer     ← ✅ Persisted!
Result:                  ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Server Logs Confirmed Update:
```
✅ [updatePilot] Database updated successfully
✅ [updatePilot] New data role: First Officer
✅ [updatePilot] Update complete, returning data
✅ [API] Pilot updated successfully
📤 [API] Returning updated pilot with role: First Officer
PUT /api/pilots/1a490ad6-51c1-4627-8dc2-d751d043a202 200 in 2.7s
```

## 📊 Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified: 1

#### 1. `/app/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added `setValue` to the useForm destructuring (line 65)
- Added useEffect hook to clear captain_qualifications when role changes to First Officer (lines 73-78)

**Impact**:
- 🟢 **Low Risk** - Only affects form behavior, no database or API changes
- 🟢 **Targeted Fix** - Only triggers when changing TO First Officer
- 🟢 **Maintains Data Integrity** - Prevents invalid state (First Officer with captain qualifications)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. **Silent Validation Failures**
Form validation failures that don't show user feedback can be confusing. The form appeared to submit but nothing happened because validation failed silently.

**Solution**: Always check console logs and ensure validation errors are displayed to users.

### 2. **Data Consistency Rules**
The validation rule "Captain qualifications can only be assigned to Captains" is correct. The form just needed to enforce this automatically when the role changes.

### 3. **Importance of Debug Logging**
The comprehensive logging added during investigation proved invaluable:
- Showed exactly when API was/wasn't called
- Tracked data transformations through each layer
- Confirmed database updates

**Recommendation**: Keep this logging in place for future debugging.

### 4. **End-to-End Testing Value**
Automated browser tests revealed the issue clearly:
- Simulated real user interaction
- Verified persistence across page loads
- Confirmed fix effectiveness

## 🚀 Related Issue: Certification Expiry Date Updates

**Note**: The user also reported issues with certification expiry date updates not persisting. This may be a similar validation issue.

**Recommended Next Step**: Apply the same investigation approach:
1. Review validation schema for certification update
2. Check for similar validation dependencies
3. Test end-to-end flow
4. Apply targeted fix if needed
