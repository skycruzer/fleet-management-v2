(node:56760) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/skycruzer/Desktop/fleet-management-v2/test-pilot-portal-comprehensive.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/skycruzer/Desktop/fleet-management-v2/package.json.
