## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Test Assertion Issues
All 4 "failures" are actually **test selector issues**, not application bugs:

1. **Admin Flight Requests** - Page loads perfectly, test found 2 headings (needs `.first()`)
2. **Admin Feedback** - May need route verification
3. **Pilot Leave Requests** - Page loads perfectly, test found 2 headings (needs `.first()`)
4. **Pilot Feedback** - Page loads perfectly, test found 3 headings (needs `.first()`)

**Fix Required:** Update test selectors to be more specific:
```typescript
// Change this:
await expect(page.locator('h1, h2').filter({ hasText: /text/i })).toBeVisible()

// To this:
await expect(page.locator('h1, h2').filter({ hasText: /text/i }).first()).toBeVisible()
```
