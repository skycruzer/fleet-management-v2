(node:63655) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/skycruzer/Desktop/fleet-management-v2/test-admin-portal-comprehensive.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/skycruzer/Desktop/fleet-management-v2/package.json.

  📡 API RESPONSE SUMMARY
================================================================================
✅ analytics: 200 OK

⚠️  Console Errors:
  - Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: http://localhost:3000/icon-192.png (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
  - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
  - A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
