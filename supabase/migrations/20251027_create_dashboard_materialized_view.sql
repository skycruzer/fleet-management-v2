-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: pilot_dashboard_metrics
-- ============================================================================
-- Sprint 2: Performance Optimization - Day 1
-- Purpose: Consolidate 9+ dashboard queries into single pre-computed view
-- Target: 5.3x performance improvement (800ms â†’ 150ms)
--
-- This materialized view aggregates all dashboard metrics:
-- - Pilot statistics (total, active, by rank, qualifications)
-- - Certification statistics (compliance, expiring, expired)
-- - Leave request statistics (by status, current month)
-- - Alert counts (critical, expiring soon)
-- - Retirement forecasts (nearing, due soon, overdue)
--
-- Refresh Strategy:
-- - Manual refresh via API endpoint: REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY
-- - Auto-refresh on data changes via triggers (future enhancement)
-- - Cache TTL: 5 minutes (balances freshness vs performance)
