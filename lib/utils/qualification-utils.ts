/**
 * CAPTAIN QUALIFICATION UTILITIES
 *
 * ========================================
 * BUSINESS RULES: CAPTAIN QUALIFICATIONS & SENIORITY
 * ========================================
 *
 * CRITICAL AVIATION OPERATIONS CONCEPT:
 *
 * Captain qualifications determine which pilots can perform specific duties
 * beyond standard flight operations. These include training, examining, and
 * special operational authorizations. This system manages and tracks these
 * qualifications with expiry-based currency tracking.
 *
 * WHY QUALIFICATION TRACKING?
 * - Regulatory compliance (FAA/CASA requirements)
 * - Training department resource allocation
 * - Examiner availability for check rides
 * - Operational flexibility and coverage
 * - Insurance and liability management
 *
 * ========================================
 * CAPTAIN QUALIFICATION TYPES
 * ========================================
 *
 * LINE CAPTAIN (Boolean):
 * - DEFINITION: Standard captain qualification for normal line operations
 * - REQUIREMENTS: Type rating + minimum flight hours + proficiency check
 * - AUTHORITY: Can command aircraft on regular scheduled flights
 * - PREREQUISITE: Required before obtaining other qualifications
 * - NO EXPIRY: Boolean flag (either qualified or not)
 *
 * TRAINING CAPTAIN / TRI (Boolean):
 * - DEFINITION: Type Rating Instructor qualification
 * - REQUIREMENTS: Line captain + training course + examiner endorsement
 * - AUTHORITY: Can conduct initial and recurrent training
 * - OPERATIONS: Simulator and aircraft training sessions
 * - SCHEDULE: Training department coordinates availability
 * - NO EXPIRY: Boolean flag (periodic revalidation required)
 *
 * EXAMINER / TRE (Boolean):
 * - DEFINITION: Type Rating Examiner qualification
 * - REQUIREMENTS: Training captain + examiner course + regulator approval
 * - AUTHORITY: Can conduct proficiency checks and skill tests
 * - OPERATIONS: Final assessment for licensing and recurrency
 * - REGULATORY: Subject to oversight by aviation authority
 * - NO EXPIRY: Boolean flag (periodic revalidation required)
 *
 * RHS CAPTAIN (Date-Based):
 * - DEFINITION: Right-Hand Seat captain qualification
 * - REQUIREMENTS: Line captain + specific training + check ride
 * - AUTHORITY: Can operate from right seat (normally FO position)
 * - USE CASES: Training, standardization, operational flexibility
 * - EXPIRY: Date-based currency (typically 6-12 months)
 * - RENEWAL: Requires recurrent check ride
 *
 * ========================================
 * SENIORITY SYSTEM
 * ========================================
 *
 * SENIORITY NUMBER:
 * - Based on commencement_date (hire date)
 * - Lower number = Higher seniority (1 = most senior)
 * - Range: 1 to N (where N = total pilots)
 * - CRITICAL: Used for leave request prioritization
 *
 * SENIORITY IMPACT:
 * - Leave request approval (higher seniority = higher priority)
 * - Roster preferences and bidding
 * - Training slot allocation
 * - Upgrade opportunities
 * - Layover accommodations
 *
 * SENIORITY CALCULATION:
 * - Sorted by commencement_date (ascending)
 * - Ties broken by hire timestamp (if available)
 * - Numbers updated when pilots join/leave fleet
 * - Maintained consistently across all systems
 *
 * ========================================
 * QUALIFICATION DATA STRUCTURE
 * ========================================
 *
 * STORAGE FORMAT (JSONB in Database):
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "line_captain": true,           // Boolean
 *   "training_captain": true,       // Boolean (TRI)
 *   "examiner": false,              // Boolean (TRE)
 *   "rhs_captain_expiry": "2025-12-31"  // ISO date string
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * FLEXIBLE DESIGN:
 * - JSONB allows schema evolution without migrations
 * - Can add new qualification types easily
 * - Null-safe handling for missing fields
 * - Backwards compatible with legacy data
 *
 * ========================================
 * RHS CAPTAIN EXPIRY RULES
 * ========================================
 *
 * STATUS THRESHOLDS (Similar to Certifications):
 * - EXPIRED (Red): expiry_date < today → qualification invalid
 * - EXPIRING (Yellow): expiry_date ≤ 30 days → renewal urgent
 * - CURRENT (Green): expiry_date > 30 days → qualification valid
 * - NOT SET (Gray): no expiry_date → qualification not held
 *
 * CALCULATION LOGIC:
 * 1. Check if rhs_captain_expiry field exists
 * 2. Parse ISO date string to Date object
 * 3. Calculate days difference from today
 * 4. Apply threshold rules for status
 *
 * OPERATIONAL IMPACT:
 * - Expired RHS: Cannot operate from right seat
 * - Does NOT affect normal left-seat operations
 * - Training department notified at 60 days
 * - Automatic alerts at 30 days (yellow status)
 *
 * ========================================
 * BUSINESS USE CASES
 * ========================================
 *
 * TRAINING SCHEDULING:
 * - Find all training captains: isTrainingCaptain()
 * - Check availability for training sessions
 * - Allocate instructors to student pilots
 * - Balance training workload across TRIs
 *
 * EXAMINER ALLOCATION:
 * - Find all examiners: isExaminer()
 * - Schedule proficiency checks
 * - Ensure examiner availability for licensing
 * - Regulatory compliance for check rides
 *
 * LEAVE REQUEST PRIORITIZATION:
 * - Compare seniority_number (lower = higher priority)
 * - Used in leave-eligibility-service.ts
 * - Ensures fair and consistent leave approval
 * - Prevents seniority disputes
 *
 * QUALIFICATION BADGES (UI):
 * - Display pilot capabilities at a glance
 * - Visual indicators in pilot cards/profiles
 * - Filter pilots by qualifications
 * - Quick identification for operations team
 *
 * COMPLIANCE REPORTING:
 * - Track expiring RHS qualifications
 * - Ensure adequate training captain coverage
 * - Monitor examiner availability
 * - Audit trail for regulatory inspections
 *
 * ========================================
 * EDGE CASES & SPECIAL SCENARIOS
 * ========================================
 *
 * NULL QUALIFICATIONS:
 * - Pilot record exists but qualifications field is null
 * - All qualification checks return false
 * - May indicate First Officer (not Captain)
 * - Data migration scenario handled gracefully
 *
 * MISSING RHS EXPIRY:
 * - Qualification exists but rhs_captain_expiry is null
 * - Interpreted as "not qualified for RHS"
 * - Gray status (not applicable)
 * - No expiry warnings generated
 *
 * FIRST OFFICERS:
 * - captain_qualifications field should be null
 * - All qualification checks return false
 * - Seniority number still applies for leave requests
 * - May become Captain via upgrade process
 *
 * RECENTLY UPGRADED:
 * - New Captain with no special qualifications yet
 * - line_captain = true (after upgrade check)
 * - Other qualifications acquired over time
 * - RHS typically obtained 6-12 months post-upgrade
 *
 * DEMOTED/DOWNGRADED:
 * - Rare scenario (medical, performance issues)
 * - Qualifications may be revoked
 * - Boolean flags set to false
 * - Seniority number typically retained
