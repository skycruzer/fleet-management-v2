## Form Issues Status

### Issue #1: Pilot Rank Update ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Rank changes didn't persist
- **Root Cause**: Form validation silently failed (qualifications not cleared)
- **Fix**: Added useEffect to auto-clear qualifications on role change
- **Status**: ✅ TESTED AND VERIFIED (E2E automated testing)
- **File**: `/app/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit/page.tsx:73-78`

### Issue #2: Certification Expiry Date Update 🧪 NEEDS TESTING
- **Problem**: Expiry date changes don't persist
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - needs manual testing
- **Investigation**: Debug logging added to all layers
- **Status**: 🧪 READY FOR MANUAL TESTING
- **Next Step**: Follow manual testing guide in FORM_ISSUES_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues (Require Careful Testing)
1. **Race Condition Fix (056)** - Complex PostgreSQL function, needs load testing
2. **Missing Foreign Key Constraints (038)** - May reveal orphaned records
3. **RLS Policies Portal Tables (032)** - Changes access patterns
4. **TypeScript Strict Null Checks (043)** - Large codebase refactoring

### Low Risk Issues (Standard Fixes)
- All database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Security hardening (logging, rate limiting)
- All UX improvements
- Code quality fixes

---

## Testing Strategy

### Database Changes
- **Pre-Migration**: Duplicate detection, NULL detection, backup
- **Post-Migration**: Verify constraints, test enforcement, regenerate types
- **Load Testing**: Race condition fix requires Artillery testing

### Security Changes
- **CSRF**: Test without token (403), invalid token (403), valid token (200)
- **Rate Limiting**: Test 100 req/s → expect 429 throttling
- **RLS**: Test pilot access isolation, admin access to all

### UX Changes
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver, NVDA, keyboard nav, axe DevTools, Lighthouse
- **Error Handling**: Network failure, API timeout, invalid form, disconnect

---

## Key Insights

### What Works Well (93% completion rate)
- Service layer architecture fully implemented ✅
- Input validation with Zod comprehensive ✅
- Security foundations strong (CSP, rate limiting, CSRF on server actions) ✅
- Testing infrastructure robust (E2E, Storybook) ✅
- Documentation thorough ✅
- Code quality high (84% code quality issues resolved) ✅

### What Needs Work (7% remaining)
- **Database constraints** missing (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FK, CHECK)
- **Race condition** in crew availability checks
- **CSRF protection** not applied to API routes
- **RLS policies** missing on portal tables
- **UX polish** needed (error handling, keyboard nav, accessibility)

### Architecture Observations
1. **Service layer pattern** working well - prevents direct DB access
2. **Dual authentication** system (admin vs pilot) properly isolated
3. **Type safety** good but can be improved with stricter DB constraints
4. **Performance** good but caching opportunities exist
5. **Security** strong foundation but gaps in API route protection

## Recommendations

### For Maurice (Developer)

1. **Start with Database Foundation** (Week 1, Day 1-2)
   - These are BLOCKERS for other work
   - Missing NOT NULL constraints (059) first
   - Then unique constraints (057)
   - Low risk, high impact

2. **Focus on Quick Wins** (Maximize early impact)
   - 13 issues can be done in 21 hours total
   - Average 1.6 hours per fix
   - High impact for minimal effort

3. **Security Hardening Next** (Week 1, Day 3-4)
   - Aviation system requires strong security
   - CSRF protection critical
   - RLS policies essential

4. **Race Condition Complex** (Week 2)
   - Requires PostgreSQL expertise
   - Needs load testing
   - Save for when database foundation is solid

5. **UX Can Be Parallel** (Week 2-3)
   - Independent of other work
   - Can be done by different developer
   - Improves user experience immediately

### For Production Deployment

**DO NOT DEPLOY** until these P1 critical issues are fixed:
1. Missing NOT NULL constraints (059)
2. Missing unique constraints (057)
3. CSRF protection for API routes (058)
4. Race condition in crew availability (056)

**CAN DEPLOY** with these known issues (P2):
- UX improvements (todos/041-053) - nice to have
- Code quality (todos/043, 055, 029) - technical debt
- Form issue #2 - needs manual testing first
