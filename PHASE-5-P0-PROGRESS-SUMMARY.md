# Phase 5 P0 Critical Fixes - Progress Summary

**Start Time**: 2025-10-28 17:35:00
**Current Status**: In Progress
**Objective**: Fix 3 critical pages with 0% pass rate → Target 69.4% overall pass rate

---

## Task 1: Fix Certifications Page (0/22 → Target +22)

### ⏳ Status: TESTING IN PROGRESS

### Problem Identified
- **Test Expected**: Table-based certification management page with:
  - Full table of all 607 certifications
  - Search by pilot name or check type
  - Filter by status (All/Current/Expiring/Expired)
  - Column headers (Pilot, Employee ID, Check Type, Expiry Date, Status)
  - Color-coded status badges
  - CRUD operations

- **Actual Implementation**: Accordion-based view showing ONLY expiring/expired certifications
  - No table element (role="table")
  - No search functionality
  - No status filters
  - Accordion UI instead of table

### Root Cause
Page at `/dashboard/certifications` was specialized for expiring-only view, but tests expected comprehensive management page.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created New Table-Based Page ✅
**File**: `/app/dashboard/certifications/page.tsx` (new comprehensive view)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Client-side table component with full data display
- ✅ Search input (placeholder: "Search by pilot name or check type...")
- ✅ Status filter dropdown (All/Current/Expiring/Expired with counts)
- ✅ Table with proper columns:
  - Pilot (with link to pilot detail)
  - Employee ID
  - Check Type
  - Expiry Date (with days remaining indicator)
  - Status (color-coded badges)
  - Actions (Edit button)
- ✅ Quick stats cards (Total/Current/Expiring/Expired counts)
- ✅ Export button
- ✅ Add Certification button
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling with retry
- ✅ Empty state handling

**API Integration**:
- Uses existing `/api/certifications` endpoint
- Returns `data.data` with certifications array
- Includes status object with color/label/daysUntilExpiry

#### 2. Enhanced Badge Component ✅
**File**: `/components/ui/badge.tsx`

**Added Variants**:
- ✅ `warning` - Yellow background for expiring certifications
- ✅ `success` - Green background for current certifications

#### 3. Organized Route Structure ✅
**Routes**:
- `/dashboard/certifications` - Full table view (NEW - what tests expect)
- `/dashboard/certifications/expiring` - Accordion view for expiring-only (MOVED from root)

### Testing
**Status**: Running 22 tests
**Command**: `npx playwright test e2e/certifications.spec.ts --timeout=120000`
**Started**: 17:44:00
**Expected Duration**: 2-3 minutes

### Expected Results
**Before**: 0/22 tests passing (0%)
**Target**: 22/22 tests passing (100%)
**Impact**: +4.9pp to overall pass rate (56.7% → 61.6%)

## Task 2: Fix Pilots Page (0/19 → Target +19)

### ⏸️ Status: PENDING (After Task 1 completes)

### Current Investigation
- Page delegates to `PilotsPageContent` component
- Component shows stats and uses `PilotsViewToggle`
- Tests expect table view with CRUD operations
- Need to verify if `PilotsViewToggle` renders table or just grouped view

### Expected Timeline
- Start: After certifications tests complete
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
- Deliverable: Table-based pilots management page

---

## Task 3: Fix Leave Approval Page (0/16 → Target +16)

### ⏸️ Status: PENDING (After Task 2 completes)

### Preliminary Notes
- Page likely not implemented at `/dashboard/leave/approve`
- Tests expect leave approval dashboard with:
  - Pending requests list
  - Approve/Deny actions
  - Eligibility alerts (10+10 minimum crew)
  - Final review alert (22 days before RP)

### Expected Timeline
- Start: After pilots tests complete
- Duration: 45-60 minutes
- Deliverable: Leave approval dashboard page

---

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Actions ✅
1. ✅ Analyzed certifications page mismatch (test vs implementation)
2. ✅ Created comprehensive table-based certifications page (550+ lines)
3. ✅ Enhanced Badge component with warning/success variants
4. ✅ Moved old accordion view to `/certifications/expiring`
5. ✅ Started certifications test execution

### In Progress ⏳
- ⏳ Running certifications tests (22 tests, ~2-3 min)

### Pending ⏸️
- ⏸️ Analyze pilots page test failures
- ⏸️ Fix pilots page implementation
- ⏸️ Test pilots page (19 tests)
- ⏸️ Analyze leave approval page failures
- ⏸️ Implement leave approval dashboard
- ⏸️ Test leave approval page (16 tests)

## Expected Outcomes

### Pass Rate Progression
- **Current**: 255/450 passing (56.7%)
- **After P0 Fixes**: 312/450 passing (69.4%) ← +12.7pp improvement

### Test Results Targets
| Page | Before | Target | Gain |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| Certifications | 0/22 (0%) | 22/22 (100%) | +22 tests |
| Pilots | 0/19 (0%) | 19/19 (100%) | +19 tests |
| Leave Approval | 0/16 (0%) | 16/16 (100%) | +16 tests |
| **TOTAL P0** | **0/57 (0%)** | **57/57 (100%)** | **+57 tests** |

### Time Estimates
- **Task 1 (Certifications)**: 30 min implementation + 3 min testing = 33 min ✅
- **Task 2 (Pilots)**: 30-45 min implementation + 3 min testing = 33-48 min
- **Task 3 (Leave Approval)**: 45-60 min implementation + 3 min testing = 48-63 min
- **Total P0 Phase**: 111-144 minutes (1.9-2.4 hours)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (After Certifications Test Completes)
1. ✅ Review certifications test results
2. ✅ Fix any remaining certification issues (if < 100% pass)
3. ✅ Move to pilots page analysis
4. ✅ Implement pilots page fixes
5. ✅ Test pilots page

### After P0 Completion
- Move to P1 tasks (Flight Requests, Leave Bids, Auth Flows)
- Target: 73.4% pass rate (+4.0pp improvement)
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
