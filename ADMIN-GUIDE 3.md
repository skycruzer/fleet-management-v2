- Other

**Eligibility Rules**:
- ‚úÖ **10 Captains** must remain available
- ‚úÖ **10 First Officers** must remain available
- Evaluated separately by rank
- If minimum met ‚Üí approve all requests
- If minimum not met ‚Üí approve by priority

**Priority System**:
1. **Seniority number** (lower = higher priority)
2. **Submission date** (earlier = better)

### Leave Request Review Process

**Access**: Dashboard ‚Üí Leave Requests

**Review Steps**:
1. Filter by roster period
2. Sort by submission date
3. Review each request:
   - Pilot name and rank
   - Requested dates
   - Leave type
   - Remaining crew count
4. Check eligibility alerts
5. Approve or reject
6. Add notes

**Eligibility Alerts**:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Eligibility Alert**:
- Shows when 2+ pilots of same rank request overlapping dates
- Review all competing requests
- Approve by priority system

üìã **Final Review Alert**:
- Appears 22 days before roster period starts
- Only shown if pending requests exist
- Deadline for processing requests

**Bulk Processing**:
1. Select roster period
2. Review all pending requests
3. Process in order of priority
4. Approve until minimum crew reached
5. Reject remaining with explanation

### Approval Decision Matrix

**Scenario 1**: Sufficient Crew Available
```
Current: 15 Captains, 12 First Officers
Request: Captain wants leave (5 days)
Remaining: 14 Captains available
Decision: ‚úÖ APPROVE (14 > 10 minimum)
```

**Scenario 2**: At Minimum Crew
```
Current: 11 Captains available
Request: Captain wants leave
Remaining: 10 Captains
Decision: ‚úÖ APPROVE (meets minimum)
```

**Scenario 3**: Below Minimum
```
Current: 10 Captains available
Request: Captain wants leave
Remaining: 9 Captains
Decision: ‚ùå REJECT (below minimum)
```

**Scenario 4**: Multiple Competing Requests
```
Requests for same dates:
1. Captain (Seniority #3, submitted Jan 1)
2. Captain (Seniority #5, submitted Dec 28)
3. Captain (Seniority #7, submitted Jan 2)

Current: 12 Captains available
Can approve: 2 requests (leave 10 available)

Approval order:
1. #3 (lowest seniority) ‚úÖ
2. #5 (second lowest) ‚úÖ
3. #7 (rejected - would drop below minimum) ‚ùå
```

### Rejection Best Practices

**Clear Communication**:
```
‚ùå Bad: "Cannot approve"
‚úÖ Good: "Unable to approve as approving would reduce available Captains to 9, below the minimum requirement of 10. Higher seniority requests approved for this period."
```

**Include**:
- Specific reason
- Reference to policy
- Alternative suggestions
- Encourage re-submit for different dates

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Admin Issues

#### Issue: Cannot Add New Pilot

**Symptoms**: Form validation errors

**Checks**:

2. Email address unique?
3. All required fields filled?
4. Date formats correct?

**Solution**: Verify uniqueness, fix validation errors

#### Issue: Leave Request Not Showing

**Symptoms**: Pilot submitted but not in admin list

**Checks**:
1. Check filters (status, roster period)
2. Verify pilot submitted successfully
3. Check database connection

**Solution**: Clear filters, refresh page

#### Issue: Certification Not Auto-Calculating Expiry

**Symptoms**: Expiry date not populated

**Checks**:
1. Check type has validity period set?
2. Check date entered correctly?
3. Database rules working?

**Solution**: Verify check type configuration, re-save certification

### Database Issues

#### Issue: Slow Queries

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Solution**: Add indexes, optimize queries

#### Issue: Connection Errors

**Symptoms**: "Unable to connect to database"

**Checks**:
1. Supabase project status
2. API keys valid?
3. Network connectivity

**Solution**: Check Supabase dashboard, verify env variables

### Performance Issues

**Slow Page Load**:
