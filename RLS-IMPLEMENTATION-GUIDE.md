## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Pilot Data Isolation ‚úÖ
**CRITICAL**: Pilots can ONLY see their own data

**Tables Protected**:
- `leave_requests` - Pilots see only their own requests
- `flight_requests` - Pilots see only their own requests
- `notifications` - Users see only their own notifications
- `leave_bids` - Pilots see only their own bids

**Policy Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "leave_requests_pilot_read_own" ON leave_requests
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (pilot_id = (SELECT id FROM pilots WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

### 2. Admin Role Protection ‚úÖ
**CRITICAL**: Prevent privilege escalation

**Tables Protected**:
- `an_users` - Users cannot change their own role
- Admin approval required for role changes

**Policy Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "an_users_users_update_own_profile" ON an_users
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (
    id = auth.uid()
    AND role = (SELECT role FROM an_users WHERE id = auth.uid())  -- Role unchanged
  );
```

### 3. Audit Trail Immutability ‚úÖ
**CRITICAL**: Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted

**Tables Protected**:
- `audit_logs` - INSERT only, no UPDATE/DELETE

**Policy Example**:
```sql
-- INSERT allowed
CREATE POLICY "audit_logs_authenticated_create" ON audit_logs
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- NO UPDATE POLICY = UPDATE DENIED ‚úÖ
-- NO DELETE POLICY = DELETE DENIED ‚úÖ
```

### 4. Status Protection ‚úÖ
**IMPORTANT**: Pilots cannot modify approved requests

**Tables Protected**:
- `leave_requests` - Can only update PENDING requests
- `flight_requests` - Can only update PENDING requests

**Policy Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "leave_requests_pilot_update_own_pending" ON leave_requests
  FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (
    pilot_id = (SELECT id FROM pilots WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
    AND status = 'PENDING'  -- Only PENDING can be updated
  );
```

### 5. Reference Data Protection ‚úÖ
**IMPORTANT**: Read-only reference data

**Tables Protected**:
- `check_types` - Admin-only writes, all authenticated read
- `contract_types` - Admin-only writes, all authenticated read

## üß™ Testing Procedures

After implementing RLS, follow these test procedures:

### Test 1: Admin Access (2 minutes)
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Verify can view all pilots
4. Verify can approve leave requests
5. Verify can view all data

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Full access to all data

### Test 2: Pilot Data Isolation (3 minutes)
1. Login as Pilot A
2. Navigate to leave requests
3. Verify see ONLY own requests (not other pilots)
4. Try to access another pilot's request URL directly
5. Verify get 404 or empty result

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Can only see own data

### Test 3: Role Protection (2 minutes)
1. Login as pilot
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network
3. Try to update own role to 'Admin' via API
4. Verify request is denied

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Role change denied

### Test 4: Audit Trail (1 minute)
1. Login as admin
2. Try to update an audit_logs record
3. Try to delete an audit_logs record

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Both operations denied

### Test 5: Status Protection (2 minutes)
1. Login as pilot
2. Create a leave request
3. Admin approves the request
4. Pilot tries to modify approved request

**Expected**: ‚úÖ Update denied (approved requests are immutable)

**Comprehensive Testing**: See `RLS-TESTING-GUIDE.md` for detailed test cases with SQL queries.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### WARNING 1: Application May Break Initially
After enabling RLS, the application may return empty results or errors until ALL policies are created.

**Solution**: Execute all policy scripts in order without delay.

### WARNING 2: Test Before Production
RLS changes can break existing functionality if policies are incorrect.

**Solution**: Test thoroughly in development first, then staging, then production.

### WARNING 3: Service Role Bypasses RLS
Code using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses all RLS policies.

**Current Usage**: Service role is NOT used in this application - all operations use user authentication.

### WARNING 4: No Rollback
Once RLS is enabled and policies are created, rolling back requires manual policy deletion.

**Mitigation**: All scripts use `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` for safe re-execution.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Empty Results After Enabling RLS
**Symptom**: Application returns no data or empty arrays

**Cause**: RLS enabled but policies not yet created

**Solution**:
1. Check if all policy scripts were executed
2. Run verification query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public'`
3. Expected: 42 policies
4. If less than 42, re-run missing policy scripts

---

### Problem: "Permission Denied" Errors
**Symptom**: API routes return 403 or permission denied

**Cause**: User doesn't meet policy USING clause conditions

**Solution**:
1. Check user's role: `SELECT role FROM an_users WHERE id = auth.uid()`
2. Check policy for that table: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'table_name'`
3. Verify user meets policy conditions

---

### Problem: Pilots See All Data (Not Isolated)
**Symptom**: Pilot A can see Pilot B's leave requests

**Cause**: Incorrect policy USING clause

**Solution**:
1. Check leave_requests policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, qual FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'leave_requests' AND cmd = 'SELECT';
```
2. Verify `pilot_read_own` policy exists
3. If missing, re-run `create-rls-policies-sensitive-data.sql`

---

### Problem: Admin Cannot Access Data
**Symptom**: Admin user gets empty results

**Cause**: Admin role check failing

**Solution**:
1. Verify admin user has correct role:
```sql
SELECT id, email, role FROM an_users WHERE role = 'Admin';
```
2. Check admin policy exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE policyname LIKE '%admin%';
```

---

## üìä Verification Queries

After implementation, run these queries to verify success:

### Query 1: RLS Status
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```
**Expected**: All tables show `rowsecurity = true`

### Query 2: Policy Count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_policies
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```
**Expected**: `total_policies = 42`

### Query 3: Policy Coverage
```sql
SELECT tablename, cmd, COUNT(*) as policies
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename, cmd
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```
**Expected**: Each table has appropriate policies for each operation

### Query 4: Critical Policies Exist
```sql
-- Check pilot data isolation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'leave_requests'
  AND policyname LIKE '%pilot_read_own%';
-- Expected: 1

-- Check admin role protection
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'an_users'
  AND policyname LIKE '%admin%';
-- Expected: 1

-- Check audit immutability (should be 0 UPDATE/DELETE policies)
SELECT cmd, COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'audit_logs'
GROUP BY cmd;
-- Expected: SELECT=1, INSERT=1, UPDATE=0, DELETE=0
```
