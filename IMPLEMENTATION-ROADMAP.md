## Risk Management

### Risk Register

**High-Risk Items** (Likelihood: High, Impact: High):

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| R1 | Database migrations fail in production | Medium | High | Test on staging, use CONCURRENTLY flag, have rollback plan | Senior Dev |
| R2 | Performance improvements don't meet targets | Medium | Medium | Early performance testing, incremental improvements, monitoring | Senior Dev |
| R3 | Theme migration breaks visual design | Low | Medium | Automated script, visual regression testing, phased rollout | Mid-Level Dev |
| R4 | Key developer becomes unavailable | Low | High | Documentation, knowledge sharing, cross-training | Both |

**Medium-Risk Items** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium):

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| R5 | Testing infrastructure setup delays | Medium | Medium | Allocate extra buffer time, start early | Mid-Level Dev |
| R6 | Service layer refactoring introduces bugs | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing, gradual migration | Senior Dev |
| R7 | Documentation takes longer than planned | Medium | Low | Prioritize critical docs, use templates | Mid-Level Dev |
| R8 | Scope creep during implementation | Medium | Medium | Strict sprint planning, change control process | Both |

**Low-Risk Items** (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Low):

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|------------------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| R9 | Flaky E2E tests remain unreliable | Low | Low | Increase test timeouts, add explicit waits | Senior Dev |
| R10 | OpenAPI documentation incomplete | Low | Low | Focus on critical endpoints first | Mid-Level Dev |

### Mitigation Strategies

#### R1: Database Migration Failure

**Prevention**:
1. Test all migrations on exact copy of production data
2. Use PostgreSQL CONCURRENTLY for index creation (no table locks)
3. Create migrations with explicit rollback scripts
4. Deploy during low-traffic window

**Detection**:
- Monitor database logs during migration
- Set up alerts for migration errors
- Verify data integrity post-migration

**Response**:
1. If migration fails: Execute rollback script immediately
2. Investigate root cause (data inconsistency, constraint violation)
3. Fix migration script, re-test on staging
4. Schedule new deployment window

**Recovery Time**: < 15 minutes (automated rollback)

#### R2: Performance Targets Not Met

**Prevention**:
1. Early performance testing (Week 3)
2. Incremental improvements (test after each change)
3. Realistic targets based on profiling data

**Detection**:
- Continuous monitoring with Datadog APM
- Weekly performance reports
- Lighthouse CI checks

**Response**:
1. Profile slow operations (identify bottleneck)
2. Implement targeted optimization
3. Re-test and measure improvement
4. Adjust targets if constraints identified

**Fallback**: Accept partial improvements, document remaining work

#### R4: Key Developer Unavailability

**Prevention**:
1. Comprehensive documentation of all work
2. Daily knowledge sharing in standups
3. Pair programming for critical tasks
4. GitHub with full commit history

**Detection**:
- Immediate notification from developer
- Weekly availability forecast

**Response**:
1. Reassign tasks to remaining developer
2. Reduce sprint scope if necessary
3. Hire contractor if extended absence
4. Extend timeline if needed

**Buffer**: 45% buffer time accounts for unexpected absences

### Contingency Planning

**If Timeline Slips**:
- Prioritize P1 issues over enhancements
- Reduce scope of testing (focus on critical paths)
- Defer documentation to separate phase
- Extend by 1-2 weeks if needed

**If Budget Exceeded**:
- Reduce developer hours (slower pace)
- Defer non-critical improvements
- Use open-source tools (no additional costs)
- Re-prioritize based on ROI

**If Critical Bug Discovered**:
- Pause current sprint
- All-hands debugging session
- Deploy hotfix to production
- Resume sprint after resolution

### Change Control Process

**Scope Change Request**:
1. Stakeholder submits change request (GitHub issue)
2. Team evaluates impact (effort, timeline, dependencies)
3. Stakeholder approval required if:
   - Adds >8 hours effort
   - Changes success criteria
   - Delays milestone by >1 week
4. Approved changes added to backlog (next sprint)

**Emergency Changes**:
- Security vulnerabilities: Immediate implementation
- Production bugs (P0): Interrupt current sprint
- All other changes: Standard process

## Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy by Sprint

#### Sprint 1: Foundation Testing

**Security Testing**:
```bash
# CSRF Protection
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/pilots \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first_name":"Test"}' \
  # Should return 403 without CSRF token

# Rate Limiting
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/portal/profile
done
# Should return 429 after 10 requests

# Log Sanitization
# Verify logs don't contain:
# - Pilot IDs
# - Employee numbers
# - Email addresses
```

**Database Testing**:
```sql
-- NOT NULL constraint
INSERT INTO pilots (first_name) VALUES (NULL);
-- Should fail: ERROR: null value in column "first_name"

-- Unique constraint
INSERT INTO pilots (employee_id, ...) VALUES ('12345', ...);
INSERT INTO pilots (employee_id, ...) VALUES ('12345', ...);
-- Should fail: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint

-- Check constraint
INSERT INTO pilots (date_of_birth, ...) VALUES ('2020-01-01', ...);
-- Should fail: ERROR: new row violates check constraint
```

**UX Testing**:
- Test error boundaries: Throw error, verify error UI displays
- Test retry logic: Simulate network failure, verify automatic retry
- Test form validation: Submit invalid data, verify inline errors

#### Sprint 2: Performance Testing

**Load Testing with k6**:
```javascript
// k6-performance-test.js
import http from 'k6/http'
import { check, sleep } from 'k6'

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 10 },  // Ramp up to 10 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 50 },   // Ramp up to 50 users
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% requests < 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],   // <1% failure rate
  },
}

export default function () {
  const dashboardRes = http.get('http://localhost:3000/portal/dashboard')
  check(dashboardRes, {
    'dashboard loads in <500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
  })

  const profileRes = http.get('http://localhost:3000/api/portal/profile')
  check(profileRes, {
    'profile API <200ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,
  })

  sleep(1)
}
```

**Lighthouse CI**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml
name: Lighthouse CI

## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Approach: Staged Rollout

**Strategy**: Progressive deployment with validation gates

```
Development → Staging → Production (10%) → Production (50%) → Production (100%)
     ↓            ↓            ↓                 ↓                    ↓
   Local       E2E Tests   Smoke Tests      Monitoring         Full Launch
   Testing                  10 users         50 users          All users
```

### Environment Configuration

**Development** (Local):
- Purpose: Feature development, debugging
- Database: Local Supabase instance or staging DB
- Deployment: `npm run dev`
- Testing: Manual, unit tests

**Staging** (Vercel Preview):
- Purpose: Integration testing, stakeholder review
- Database: Staging Supabase project
- Deployment: Automatic on PR creation
- Testing: E2E tests, integration tests, manual QA

**Production** (Vercel Production):
- Purpose: Live application serving real users
- Database: Production Supabase project
- Deployment: Manual trigger after approval
- Testing: Smoke tests, monitoring

### Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deployment** (1 hour before):
```
□ All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
□ Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90
□ Security audit complete (zero high-severity)
□ Code review approved (2+ approvals)
□ Database migrations tested on staging
□ Rollback plan documented
□ Stakeholder approval obtained
□ Deployment notification sent to team
□ Better Stack logging verified
□ Monitoring dashboards ready
```

**Deployment Steps** (30 minutes):
```
1. Create deployment branch
   git checkout -b deploy/sprint-X
   git push origin deploy/sprint-X

2. Trigger Vercel production deployment
   vercel --prod

3. Run database migrations (if any)
   npm run db:deploy

4. Verify deployment
   - Check build logs (no errors)
   - Verify deployment URL
   - Run smoke tests

5. Monitor for 15 minutes
   - Check error rates (Better Stack)
   - Monitor performance (Datadog)
   - Watch user activity (Vercel Analytics)

6. If issues detected: ROLLBACK
   vercel rollback

7. If stable: Announce deployment
   Post in Slack: "Sprint X deployed successfully"
```

**Post-Deployment** (24 hours):
```
□ Monitor error rates (target: <0.1%)
□ Verify performance metrics (dashboard < 200ms)
□ Check user feedback (support tickets)
□ Review APM dashboards (latency, throughput)
□ Validate success metrics
□ Document lessons learned
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Trigger Criteria**:
- Error rate > 1%
- Dashboard load time > 2 seconds
- Database connection failures
- Critical functionality broken
- Security incident detected

**Rollback Steps** (5 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback to previous Vercel deployment
vercel rollback

# 2. Rollback database migrations (if deployed)
npm run db:rollback

# 3. Verify rollback successful
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# 4. Notify team
echo "Deployment rolled back. Investigation in progress."

# 5. Post-mortem
# - Identify root cause
# - Fix issue
# - Re-test on staging
# - Schedule new deployment
```

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 5 minutes
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Zero data loss (database not affected)

### Sprint-Specific Deployment Plans

**Sprint 1 Deployment** (Week 2, Friday):
- Changes: 13 quick wins, database constraints, CSRF protection
- Risk: Medium (database migrations)
- Strategy: Deploy during low-traffic window (Friday 6 PM)
- Rollback: Simple (no breaking changes to API contracts)

**Sprint 2 Deployment** (Week 4, Friday):
- Changes: Materialized views, caching, bundle optimization
- Risk: Medium-High (database views, performance changes)
- Strategy: Canary deployment (10% → 50% → 100% over 48 hours)
- Rollback: Complex (need to drop materialized views)

**Sprint 3 Deployment** (Week 6, Friday):
- Changes: No user-facing changes (tests only)
- Risk: Low
- Strategy: Standard deployment
- Rollback: N/A (tests don't affect production)

**Sprint 4 Deployment** (Week 8, Friday):
- Changes: Theme migration, service layer cleanup, documentation
- Risk: Medium (visual changes)
- Strategy: Deploy with feature flag (gradual rollout)
- Rollback: Simple (revert theme CSS)
