# Test Report - Fleet Management V2
**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Tester**: Claude Code  
**Test Credentials**: skycruzer@icloud.com / mron2393  
**Environment**: Development (localhost:3000)

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive testing of Fleet Management V2 covering all implemented user stories (US1-6). Authentication and core features work well, but **critical issues found** in Tasks and Disciplinary Matters pages. **Navigation links were missing** for all newly implemented pages.

**Overall Status**: ⚠️ **Partial Success** - Core features work, new features have critical bugs

---

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Missing Navigation Links ✅ FIXED

### Issue
All newly implemented pages were missing from the sidebar navigation. Users could only access them by typing URLs directly.

Missing from sidebar:
- ❌ Tasks
- ❌ Disciplinary Matters
- ❌ Flight Requests
- ❌ Audit Logs

### Fix Applied
Updated `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to include all 10 navigation items with appropriate icons:
- Flight Requests (Plane icon)
- Tasks (CheckSquare icon)
- Disciplinary (AlertTriangle icon)
- Audit Logs (ScrollText icon)

**File Modified**: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx:29-68`

## Test Results Summary

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ PASS | Login works, session persists |
| Dashboard | ✅ PASS | All metrics display correctly |
| Leave Requests | ✅ PASS | Excellent - most polished feature |
| Flight Requests | ✅ PASS | Works but needs more test data |
| Tasks | ❌ ERROR | JavaScript error prevents page load |
| Disciplinary | ❌ ERROR | Data fetch failure |
| Audit Logs | ❌ MISSING | Returns 404 |
| Navigation | ✅ FIXED | Added missing links |

## Critical Issues

### 1. Tasks Page - JavaScript Error (Priority 1)
**URL**: `/dashboard/tasks`  
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'INTERNAL_ERROR')`  
**Impact**: Complete page failure - shows error boundary  
**Fix Required**: Check ERROR_MESSAGES import in task-service.ts

### 2. Disciplinary Matters - Data Fetch Failure (Priority 1)
**URL**: `/dashboard/disciplinary`  
**Error**: "Failed to fetch disciplinary matters"  
**Impact**: Page loads but no data displayed  
**Fix Required**: Check database table exists and RLS policies

### 3. Audit Logs - Not Implemented (Priority 2)
**URL**: `/dashboard/audit-logs`  
**Status**: 404 - Page not found  
**Impact**: No UI for audit trail  
**Fix Required**: Create page or mark as not implemented
