## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) OR sequentially in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (notifications) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (notifications) but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent (adds audit logging to all features)
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (pilot task notifications) but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (comment notifications) but independently testable
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 (registration approval triggers pilot account creation) but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Service layer before API routes
- API routes before UI pages
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All services within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All API routes within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Pilot Portal)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Leave Requests)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 2 independently
7. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Flight Requests)
8. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 3 independently
9. **MVP COMPLETE**: Deploy/demo US1-US3

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational â†’ Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Pilot Portal live!)
3. Add User Story 2 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Leave requests enabled!)
4. Add User Story 3 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Flight requests live! **MVP complete**)
5. Add User Story 4 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Audit logging active)
6. Add User Story 5 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Task management ready)
7. Add User Story 6 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Disciplinary tracking available)
8. Add User Story 7 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Feedback community live)
9. Add User Story 8 â†’ Test independently â†’ Deploy/Demo (Registration approval workflow complete)
10. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Pilot Portal)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Leave Requests)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Flight Requests)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Continue with US4-US8 as capacity allows

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Total Tasks**: 150 tasks
**MVP Scope (US1-US3)**: 67 tasks (T001-T067)
**Full Scope (US1-US8)**: 150 tasks
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 8-10 weeks (2 developers full-time)

**Task Breakdown by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 24 tasks (BLOCKING)
- Phase 3 (US1 - Pilot Portal): 18 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Leave Requests): 10 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Flight Requests): 12 tasks (MVP complete at T067)
- Phase 6 (US4 - Audit Logging): 11 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Task Management): 13 tasks
- Phase 8 (US6 - Disciplinary): 13 tasks
- Phase 9 (US7 - Feedback): 18 tasks
- Phase 10 (US8 - Registration): 10 tasks
- Phase 11 (Polish): 18 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 85+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
