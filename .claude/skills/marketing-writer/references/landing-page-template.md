# Landing Page Feature Sections Template

## Structure: Problem → Solution → Benefit

Each feature section follows this three-part narrative:

### 1. Problem (Hook)

Start with the pain point. Make it relatable and specific.

**Framework:**

- Lead with what sucks about the status quo
- Use "you" language to make it personal
- Be specific about the frustration

**Examples:**

- "Tired of manually tracking pilot certifications in spreadsheets?"
- "Lost track of when your team's licenses expire?"
- "Spending hours reconciling crew schedules with certification dates?"

### 2. Solution (Feature Description)

Explain what the feature does in plain English. No marketing fluff.

**Framework:**

- One sentence max
- Action-oriented (what it does, not what it is)
- Simple, direct language

**Examples:**

- "Get automatic alerts 30, 60, and 90 days before any certification expires."
- "See all your crew's certifications in one dashboard, updated in real-time."
- "Match crew availability with certification requirements instantly."

### 3. Benefit (Outcome)

Show the real-world impact. What changes for the user?

**Framework:**

- Focus on time saved or stress reduced
- Concrete outcomes, not abstract value
- Keep it practical

**Examples:**

- "No more last-minute scrambling to find replacement crew."
- "Save 5+ hours per week on crew compliance tracking."
- "Never ground a flight because someone's license expired."

## Full Section Example

**Manual Tracking Is a Nightmare**
Spreadsheets get out of date the moment you update them. You're constantly wondering if that pilot's instrument rating is still valid or if you're about to ground a $50M aircraft.

**Auto-Track Everything**
The system monitors all certifications and sends you alerts 30, 60, and 90 days before expiry.

**Fly Without the Worry**
No more surprise groundings. No more manual checks before every flight. Just clear visibility into who's current and who needs renewal.

## Voice Guidelines

- Lead with frustration, not features
- Use "you" not "our users" or "pilots"
- Be conversational like talking to a colleague
- No buzzwords: avoid "leverage," "synergy," "revolutionize," "game-changing"
- Specifics > generalities: "Save 5 hours" not "Save time"
