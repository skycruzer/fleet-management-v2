# Launch Email Template

## Structure: Personal Opening → Specific Value Prop → Easy CTA

### 1. Personal Opening

Start with why you built this. Make it human.

**Framework:**

- No "Dear valued customer" or "We're excited to announce"
- Start with a story or observation
- 2-3 sentences max
- Make it conversational

**Examples:**

- "Last month, I watched my team spend 6 hours manually checking pilot certifications before a critical flight. That shouldn't be a thing in 2024."
- "Quick question: how much time did you spend last week tracking crew certifications? If the answer is 'too much,' keep reading."
- "I built this because I was tired of spreadsheets. Figured you might be too."

### 2. Specific Value Proposition

What this does for them specifically. Not what it is, but what it solves.

**Framework:**

- Lead with the problem being solved
- Explain the solution in one clear sentence
- Show the tangible benefit
- Use concrete numbers when possible

**Examples:**

- "The problem: Crew certification tracking eats hours every week and one missed expiry grounds flights. The solution: Automated tracking with smart alerts. The result: You get your evenings back and never worry about surprise groundings."
- "Built a system that monitors all your crew certifications and pings you 30/60/90 days before anything expires. Saves most teams 5+ hours per week on compliance tracking."

### 3. Easy Call to Action

Make the next step stupid simple.

**Framework:**

- One action only
- Remove all friction
- Be specific about what happens next
- No pressure

**Examples:**

- "Want to check it out? Reply to this email and I'll send you a login."
- "Try it free for 30 days. No card required, no sales calls. Just hit reply and I'll get you set up today."
- "Interested? Book 15 minutes on my calendar [link] to see if it fits your workflow."

## Full Email Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Launch

**Subject:** Finally fixed the certification tracking mess

Hey [Name],

Last quarter, we grounded two flights because someone's instrument rating expired without notice. Digging into it, the data was there - just buried across three Excel files and an old database.

So I built something simpler. The system now auto-tracks every certification and sends alerts 30, 60, and 90 days before expiry. Takes two minutes to set up. Flight ops teams using it are saving 5+ hours per week on compliance checks.

Want early access? Just reply to this email and I'll get you set up today. No credit card, no hassle.

### Example 2: Product Launch

**Subject:** Crew management without the spreadsheet hell

Hey [Name],

Quick question: How much time did your team spend last week tracking pilot certifications, licenses, and medical certs?

If the answer is "too much," I built something for you.

It's a simple dashboard that auto-tracks every certification your crew needs. When something's about to expire, you get an alert. No more manual checks. No more surprise groundings.

Flight ops teams using it are saving 5+ hours per week and haven't had an unexpected grounding in 6 months.

Interested? Reply and I'll send you a demo login. Try it free for 30 days, no strings attached.

### Example 3: Feature Update

**Subject:** New: Bulk crew onboarding in 60 seconds

Hey [Name],

You asked if there was a faster way to add new crew members. There is now.

Upload a CSV with crew info and certifications. System imports everything, sets up tracking, and schedules renewal alerts automatically.

Takes about 60 seconds to onboard an entire crew.
