### Tweet 1: Hook

Grab attention with the problem or surprising insight.

**Framework:**

- Start with a relatable pain point or bold statement
- Make it scroll-stopping
- Question or statement format
- 280 characters max

**Examples:**

### Tweet 2-3: Build Credibility

Establish why you understand the problem.

**Framework:**

- Share relevant experience

**Examples:**

- "Worked at Air Niugini managing B767 crew. Watched us ground a $50M aircraft because someone's instrument rating expired 2 days prior."

### Tweet 3-4: Show Value

Explain the solution and its impact.

**Framework:**

- What you built/offer

## Full Thread Example

**Tweet 1:**
Ever wonder why aviation compliance software costs $50k/year but still uses spreadsheets under the hood?

I spent the last 6 months fixing this. Here's what I learned:

**Tweet 2:**
Worked at Air Niugini managing B767 operations.

Watched us ground a $50M aircraft because someone's instrument rating expired 2 days earlier.

The kicker? We HAD the data. Just buried in three different Excel files.

**Tweet 3:**
After that, I talked to 20+ flight ops teams.

Everyone had the same story:

- Manual spreadsheet tracking
- Constant stress about expirations
- Last-minute crew swaps
- Hours spent on compliance checks

**Tweet 4:**
So I built something dead simple:

Auto-track every certification and license. System sends alerts 30/60/90 days before expiry. Dashboard shows who's current, who needs renewal.

Takes literally 2 minutes to set up.

**Tweet 5:**
Flight ops managers using it now save 5+ hours per week on compliance tracking.

Zero surprise groundings in the last 6 months.
