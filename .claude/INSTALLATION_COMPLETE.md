## 🔄 Updating Agents

To update agents in the future:

edit .claude/commands/review-typescript.md

# Copy to global
cp .claude/commands/review-typescript.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Now updated globally!
```

## 🌐 Global vs Project-Specific

**Global Installation** (✅ Completed):
- Available in ALL projects
- Installed at: `~/.claude/commands/`
- Update once, applies everywhere

**Project-Specific** (Also Available):
- This project: `.claude/commands/`
- Customized for Fleet Management V2
- Version controlled with project

**Both work together!** Project-specific commands override global ones when present.

## 💡 Usage Tips

### 1. Sequential Workflow
Run agents in sequence for comprehensive review:
```bash
/review-typescript
/simplify-code
/security-audit
/optimize-performance
```

### 2. Parallel Execution
Claude can run multiple agents in parallel for efficiency!

### 3. Targeted Analysis
Provide context for focused review:
```
User: "Review the authentication service for security"
Assistant: "Running security audit with /security-audit"
```

### 4. Research First
When implementing new features:
```bash
# Research first
/research-framework Next.js 15 middleware
/research-best-practices API authentication patterns

# Then implement
# (your code)

# Then review
/review-typescript
/security-audit
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found

**Problem**: Command not working in new project

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if globally installed
ls ~/.claude/commands/review-typescript.md

# If missing, reinstall
./install-global-agents.sh
```

### Command Not Recognized

**Problem**: Claude doesn't recognize `/review-typescript`

**Solution**: Ensure file naming is correct:
- File name: `review-typescript.md` (no leading slash)
- Command: `/review-typescript` (with leading slash)

### Agent Behavior Issues

**Problem**: Agent not behaving as expected

**Solution**: Check agent documentation:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/commands/review-typescript.md
```
