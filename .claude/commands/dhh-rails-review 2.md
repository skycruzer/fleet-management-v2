## Why Use This Agent

Even though this is a Next.js project, DHH's Rails philosophy applies:

**Service Layer Pattern** (Rails-inspired):
- ✅ Fat models, skinny controllers → Fat services, thin routes
- ✅ Convention over configuration
- ✅ RESTful API design
- ✅ Simple, pragmatic solutions

**Anti-Over-Engineering:**
- ❌ Unnecessary abstractions
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Framework contamination (bringing SPA patterns to backend)
- ❌ Microservices when monolith works
- ❌ Complex dependency injection

## Perfect For

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoint design
- Response format conventions
- CRUD operation patterns
- Resource naming

**Backend Architecture:**
- Service layer simplicity
- Database interaction patterns
- Business logic organization
- Authentication flows
