# /optimize-performance

Analyze and optimize code for performance and scalability.

## When to Use

Use this command for:
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Database query optimization
- API response time improvements
- React component rendering optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Scalability concerns

## What It Does

Invokes the **performance-oracle** agent which:
- Identifies performance bottlenecks
- Reviews database queries for efficiency
- Analyzes caching strategies
- Checks memory usage patterns
- Reviews algorithm complexity
- Validates scalability
- Suggests optimization strategies

## Usage

```bash
/optimize-performance
```

Optional: Target specific areas
```
"Optimize database queries in pilot service"
"Check API endpoint performance"
"Review component rendering performance"
```

## Example

After implementing analytics:
```
You: "Analytics feature is slow - can you optimize it?"
Assistant: "Running performance analysis with /optimize-performance"
```
