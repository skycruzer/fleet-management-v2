```
CAC = $140,000 / 30 = $4,667 per customer
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**

```
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):
- Average contract: $15,000/year
- Churn rate: 10% annually (optimistic)
- Customer lifetime: 10 years
- LTV = $15,000 × 10 × (1 - 0.10 discount for churn) = $135,000

LTV:CAC Ratio = $135,000 / $4,667 = 29:1 (excellent)
```

**Note**: Even with higher CAC in Year 2 ($4,667), LTV:CAC ratio is exceptional (target is 3:1+).
