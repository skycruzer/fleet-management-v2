# Certification Renewal Planning System

## Overview

The Certification Renewal Planning System is an intelligent load-balancing system that distributes pilot certification renewals across 28-day roster periods throughout the year. This prevents clustering of renewals and ensures operational capacity is maintained.

**Key Benefits:**

- âœ… Prevents certification renewal bottlenecks
- âœ… Distributes workload across the entire year
- âœ… Respects grace period rules for different certification types
- âœ… Provides capacity utilization visibility
- âœ… Enables proactive planning and scheduling

## System Architecture

### Database Tables

#### 1. `certification_renewal_plans`

Main table storing renewal plans for each pilot certification.

**Columns:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `pilot_id` - Reference to pilots table
- `check_type_id` - Reference to check_types table
- `original_expiry_date` - When the certification expires
- `planned_renewal_date` - Planned date for renewal
- `planned_roster_period` - Assigned roster period (e.g., "RP12/2025")
- `renewal_window_start` - Earliest date renewal can occur
- `renewal_window_end` - Latest date renewal can occur (expiry date)
- `status` - Current status (planned, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- `priority` - Priority score (0-10, higher = more urgent)
- `paired_pilot_id` - Optional paired pilot for simulator checks
- `notes` - Additional notes

**Constraints:**

- `planned_renewal_date` must fall between `renewal_window_start` and `renewal_window_end`
- Priority must be between 0-10

#### 2. `roster_period_capacity`

Defines capacity limits for each roster period by certification category.

**Columns:**

- `roster_period` - Period identifier (e.g., "RP12/2025")
- `period_start_date` - Start date of roster period
- `period_end_date` - End date of roster period
- `max_pilots_per_category` - JSONB object with capacity limits

**Default Capacity Limits:**

```json
{
  "Pilot Medical": 4,
  "Flight Checks": 4,
  "Simulator Checks": 6,
  "Ground Courses Refresher": 8
}
```

#### 3. `renewal_plan_history`

Audit trail for all changes to renewal plans.

**Columns:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `renewal_plan_id` - Reference to certification_renewal_plans
- `change_type` - Type of change (date_change, status_change, etc.)
- `previous_date` - Date before change
- `new_date` - Date after change
- `reason` - Reason for change
- `changed_by` - User who made the change
- `changed_at` - Timestamp of change

---

## Grace Period Rules

Different certification types have different grace periods - the time window before expiry when renewal is allowed:

| Category                      | Grace Period | Renewal Window        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Pilot Medical**             | 28 days      | 28 days before expiry |
| **Flight Checks**             | 90 days      | 90 days before expiry |
| **Simulator Checks**          | 90 days      | 90 days before expiry |
| **Ground Courses Refresher**  | 60 days      | 60 days before expiry |
| **ID Cards**                  | 0 days       | On expiry date only   |
| **Foreign Pilot Work Permit** | 0 days       | On expiry date only   |
| **Travel Visa**               | 0 days       | On expiry date only   |

**Example:**

- Medical certification expires: December 15, 2025
- Grace period: 28 days
- Renewal window: November 17, 2025 - December 15, 2025
- System will assign to any roster period within this window

---

## Load Balancing Algorithm

### How It Works

1. **Fetch Expiring Certifications**
   - Query all certifications expiring in the next N months (default: 12)
   - Filter by category if specified

2. **Calculate Renewal Windows**
   - For each certification, calculate start and end dates based on grace period
   - Example: Medical expiring Dec 15 â†’ Window: Nov 17 - Dec 15

3. **Find Eligible Roster Periods**
   - Get all roster periods that overlap with the renewal window
   - Example: Window Nov 17 - Dec 15 might include RP11/2025 and RP12/2025

4. **Load Balancing**
   - For each eligible period, calculate current load (renewals already assigned)
   - Assign certification to period with lowest load
   - Respect capacity limits per category

5. **Date Clamping**
   - Set planned date to roster period start date
   - If period start is before renewal window start, clamp to window start
   - If period start is after renewal window end, clamp to window end
   - **Critical:** This ensures `planned_renewal_date` always falls within the valid renewal window

6. **Priority Calculation**
   - Calculate priority based on days until expiry
   - < 30 days = priority 9-10 (critical)
   - 30-60 days = priority 7-8 (high)
   - 60-90 days = priority 5-6 (medium)
   - > 90 days = priority 1-4 (low)

## Capacity Management

### Viewing Capacity Utilization

**Dashboard Level:**

- Count of high-risk periods (>80%)
- Visual color coding on period cards

**Period Level:**

- Total renewals vs total capacity
- Breakdown by category with progress bars
- Warning message if >80% utilized

### Adjusting Capacity Limits

Capacity limits are defined in the `roster_period_capacity` table.

**To adjust:**

1. Access database directly (Supabase dashboard)
2. Update `max_pilots_per_category` JSONB field
3. Example:

```sql
UPDATE roster_period_capacity
SET max_pilots_per_category = jsonb_set(
  max_pilots_per_category,
  '{Pilot Medical}',
  '6'
)
WHERE roster_period = 'RP12/2025';
```

**Recommended Limits:**

- Pilot Medical: 4 (1 per week)
- Flight Checks: 4 (1 per week)
- Simulator Checks: 6 (2 per week, can pair pilots)
- Ground Courses: 8 (can handle larger groups)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Plans not generating

**Symptoms:** Generate button clicked but no plans created

**Possible Causes:**

1. No certifications expiring in the planning window
2. Database connection issue
3. RLS policy blocking inserts

**Solution:**

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify certifications exist with expiry dates in range
3. Check Supabase logs for policy violations

---

### Issue: High utilization across all periods

**Symptoms:** Most periods showing >80% utilization

**Possible Causes:**

1. Many certifications expiring around the same time
2. Capacity limits too low
3. Grace periods too short

**Solution:**

1. Consider staggering certification expiry dates when issuing renewals
2. Increase capacity limits if operationally feasible
3. Review grace period settings

---

### Issue: "Unknown" showing for pilot names

**Symptoms:** Roster period detail page shows "Unknown" instead of pilot names

**Possible Causes:**

1. Supabase relationship not configured correctly
2. RLS policy blocking pilot data access
3. Join query syntax issue

**Solution:**

1. Check Supabase relationship configuration
2. Verify RLS policies allow reading pilot data
3. Review service layer join queries

---

### Issue: Constraint violation error

**Symptoms:** Database error about `valid_renewal_window` constraint

**Possible Causes:**

1. Planned date falls outside renewal window
2. Date clamping logic not working
3. Invalid input dates

**Solution:**

1. Verify date clamping logic in `generateRenewalPlan()`
2. Check that planned date is between window start and end
3. Review input certification data for validity

---

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations

- Plan generation for 247 renewals takes ~2-3 seconds
- Database queries use proper indexes on dates and foreign keys
- Load balancing algorithm is O(n\*m) where n=certifications, m=roster periods
- CSV export streams data for large datasets

### Security

- All API endpoints require authentication
- RLS policies enforce data access controls
- Audit trail tracks all plan modifications
- No sensitive data in client-side state

### Browser Compatibility

- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Requires modern browser with ES2020 support
- Mobile responsive design
