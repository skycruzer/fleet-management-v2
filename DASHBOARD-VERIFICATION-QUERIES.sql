-- Purpose: SQL queries to verify dashboard data accuracy
-- Database: Supabase Project (wgdmgvonqysflwdiiols)

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. VERIFY PILOT REQUIREMENTS SETTINGS EXISTS AND IS VALID
-- ============================================================================

-- Check if pilot_requirements setting exists
SELECT 
  id,
  key,
  value,
  description,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM settings
WHERE key = 'pilot_requirements';

-- Detailed check of requirements values (extract each field)

-- ============================================================================
-- 6. VERIFY EXAMINER AND TRAINING CAPTAIN REQUIREMENTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Calculate required vs actual examiners
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as actual_examiners,
  CEIL(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / 
    (SELECT (value->>'examiners_per_pilots')::integer
