# Renewal Plan Final Changes - 3-Category System

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Change Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Updated the **Generate Renewal Plan** feature to focus on three certification categories with grace periods suitable for advance planning:

1. **Flight Checks** (90-day grace period)
2. **Simulator Checks** (90-day grace period)
3. **Ground Courses Refresher** (60-day grace period)

This enables even distribution of renewals across roster periods throughout the year for strategic planning purposes.

---

## Database Analysis

### Current Data (as of October 24, 2025)

| Category | Total Checks | Unique Pilots | Earliest Expiry | Latest Expiry | Grace Period |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Flight Checks** | 43 | 26 | Dec 17, 2025 | Oct 30, 2026 | 90 days |
| **Simulator Checks** | 51 | 26 | Nov 26, 2025 | Jan 13, 2027 | 90 days |
| **Ground Courses Refresher** | 131 | 26 | Nov 5, 2025 | Dec 31, 2099* | 60 days |

**Combined Total**: **225 checks** across 26 pilots

_*Note: Some Ground Courses have distant expiry dates (2099), indicating non-expiring or placeholder certifications._

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (UI)

**File**: `app/dashboard/renewal-planning/generate/page.tsx`

#### Final Category List
```typescript
const CATEGORIES = [
  'Flight Checks',
  'Simulator Checks',
  'Ground Courses Refresher',
]
```

#### Default Selection
All three categories pre-selected by default:
```typescript
const [selectedCategories, setSelectedCategories] = useState<string[]>(CATEGORIES)
```

#### Updated UI Text

**Page Title**:
```
Generate renewal schedule for Flight, Simulator, and Ground Courses (60-90 day grace periods)
```

**Category Filter Description**:
```
All three categories selected by default. These certifications have grace periods
(60-90 days) suitable for advance planning, allowing renewals to be evenly distributed
across roster periods throughout the year.
```

**How It Works**:
- • Fetches checks expiring in time horizon (Flight, Simulator, Ground Courses)
- • Grace periods: 90 days (Flight/Simulator), 60 days (Ground Courses)
- • Assigns to roster periods with lowest load
- • Respects capacity: Flight (4), Simulator (6), Ground (8) pilots per period
- • Distributes renewals evenly throughout the year

---

### 2. Backend Changes (Service Layer)

**File**: `lib/services/certification-renewal-planning-service.ts`

#### Fixed Category Filtering

Added two-step query to properly filter by categories:

```typescript
// Step 1a: Get check_type_ids for selected categories
let checkTypeIds: string[] | undefined
if (categories && categories.length > 0) {
  const { data: checkTypes } = await supabase
    .from('check_types')
    .select('id')
    .in('category', categories)

  checkTypeIds = checkTypes?.map((ct) => ct.id) || []

  if (checkTypeIds.length === 0) {
    return []
  }
}

// Step 1b: Filter pilot_checks by check_type_ids
if (checkTypeIds && checkTypeIds.length > 0) {
  query = query.in('check_type_id', checkTypeIds)
}
```

**Critical Fix**: This ensures category filtering works correctly with Supabase nested relations.

---

## Grace Period Logic

### Defined in `grace-period-utils.ts`

```typescript
export const GRACE_PERIODS: Record<string, number> = {
  'Flight Checks': 90,
  'Simulator Checks': 90,
  'Ground Courses Refresher': 60,
  // ... other categories not used in planning
}
```

### Renewal Window Calculation

**Formula**:
- Window Start = Expiry Date - Grace Period Days
- Window End = Expiry Date

**Examples**:

| Category | Expiry Date | Grace Period | Window Start | Window End | Window Size |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Flight Checks | Mar 31, 2026 | 90 days | Jan 1, 2026 | Mar 31, 2026 | 90 days |
| Simulator Checks | Apr 15, 2026 | 90 days | Jan 15, 2026 | Apr 15, 2026 | 90 days |
| Ground Courses | May 20, 2026 | 60 days | Mar 21, 2026 | May 20, 2026 | 60 days |

---

## Capacity Management

### Capacity Limits (per Roster Period)

From `roster_period_capacity` table:

```json
{
  "Flight Checks": 4,
  "Simulator Checks": 6,
  "Ground Courses Refresher": 8
}
```

### Total Capacity per Period

**Total**: 4 + 6 + 8 = **18 pilots per roster period**

### Utilization Calculation

With 225 total checks and 13 roster periods:
- **Average**: 225 / 13 = **17.3 checks per period** (~96% utilization)
- **Status**: 🔴 Red (high utilization - above 80% threshold)

**Note**: The high utilization (96%) is primarily driven by the large number of Ground Courses Refresher checks (131). This is expected and the system will distribute them as evenly as possible across available periods.

### Expected Distribution

If planning for 12 months ahead (default):

| Category | Expected Plans* | Capacity per Period | Periods Needed (min) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Flight Checks | ~40 | 4 | 10 periods |
| Simulator Checks | ~48 | 6 | 8 periods |
| Ground Courses | ~100-120 | 8 | 12-15 periods |

_*Assuming certifications expiring within 12 months with grace period windows_

**Challenge**: Ground Courses may exceed capacity in some periods due to high volume (131 total checks). The algorithm will:
1. Distribute as evenly as possible
2. Warn when capacity exceeded (console log)
3. Still create the plan (capacity is guidance, not hard limit)

---

## Algorithm Behavior

### Distribution Logic (Unchanged)

1. **Fetch Certifications**: Get all checks (Flight, Simulator, Ground Courses) expiring in next N months
2. **Calculate Windows**: For each check, compute grace period renewal window
3. **Find Eligible Periods**: Determine which roster periods fall within the renewal window
4. **Load Balancing**: For each certification:
   - Check current allocation for all eligible periods
   - Select period with **lowest current load**
   - Add certification to that period
   - Update in-memory allocation tracking
5. **Capacity Check**: Log warning if period capacity exceeded (but still create plan)

### Priority Scoring (0-10 scale)

Based on days until expiry:
- **10**: Expired (critical)
- **9**: ≤14 days (critical)
- **7**: ≤30 days (high)
- **5**: ≤60 days (medium)
- **3**: ≤90 days (normal)
- **1**: >90 days (low)

---

## Business Impact

### Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Now includes Ground Courses (131 checks) in addition to Flight (43) and Simulator (51)
2. **Even Distribution**: Algorithm distributes 225+ renewals across 13 roster periods
3. **Strategic Planning**: All three categories have sufficient grace periods (60-90 days) for advance scheduling
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Training center utilization optimized across all three check types
5. **Simplified UI**: All planning-suitable categories pre-selected by default

### Rationale for Category Selection

**Included Categories** (have grace periods):
- ✅ Flight Checks (90 days) - Requires advance booking with training center
- ✅ Simulator Checks (90 days) - Requires simulator scheduling and availability
- ✅ Ground Courses Refresher (60 days) - Requires classroom scheduling and instructor availability

**Excluded Categories** (no advance planning needed):
- ❌ Pilot Medical (28 days) - Short grace period, different planning cycle
- ❌ ID Cards (0 days) - Renew on/after expiry, no advance planning
- ❌ Foreign Pilot Work Permit (0 days) - Renew on/after expiry
- ❌ Travel Visa (0 days) - Renew on/after expiry

## Expected Generation Results

### Scenario: Generate plan for 12 months ahead (default)

**Input Parameters**:
```json
{
  "monthsAhead": 12,
  "categories": [
    "Flight Checks",
    "Simulator Checks",
    "Ground Courses Refresher"
  ]
}
```

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalPlans": 180-200,  // Certifications expiring within 12 months
    "byCategory": {
      "Flight Checks": 35-40,
      "Simulator Checks": 45-50,
      "Ground Courses Refresher": 100-110
    },
    "rosterPeriodSummary": [
      { "rosterPeriod": "RP11/2025", "totalRenewals": 14 },
      { "rosterPeriod": "RP12/2025", "totalRenewals": 16 },
      { "rosterPeriod": "RP13/2025", "totalRenewals": 15 },
      { "rosterPeriod": "RP1/2026", "totalRenewals": 17 },
      // ... continues for ~10-12 periods
    ]
  }
}
```

**Distribution Analysis**:
- **Total Capacity per Period**: 18 pilots (4 Flight + 6 Simulator + 8 Ground)
- **Expected per Period**: ~15-17 renewals (83-94% utilization)
- **High-Risk Periods**: Likely 8-10 periods with >80% utilization (due to Ground Courses volume)

---

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. **Navigate**: Dashboard → Renewal Planning → Generate Plan
2. **Default State**: All 3 categories pre-selected (Flight, Simulator, Ground Courses)
3. **Configure**: Adjust time horizon (default 12 months)
4. **Optional**: Uncheck categories if needed (though all recommended)
5. **Optional**: Check "Clear existing plans" if regenerating
6. **Generate**: Click button → System processes 180-200+ certifications
7. **Result**: View distribution across roster periods in dashboard

### Visual Indicators (Dashboard)

After generation, dashboard shows:
- **Green periods** (<60% utilization): ~2-3 periods
- **Yellow periods** (60-80% utilization): ~3-4 periods
- **Red periods** (>80% utilization): ~5-7 periods (expected due to Ground Courses volume)

**Note**: Red periods are expected and normal when including Ground Courses Refresher (131 checks). The system distributes as evenly as possible within grace period constraints.

---

## Removed Categories

The following categories are **not included** in the Generate Plan feature:

| Category | Grace Period | Reason for Exclusion |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Pilot Medical | 28 days | Too short for advance planning, different cycle |
| ID Cards | 0 days | No advance planning needed (renew on expiry) |
| Foreign Pilot Work Permit | 0 days | No advance planning needed |
| Travel Visa | 0 days | No advance planning needed |
| Non-renewal | 0 days | Not applicable |

**Note**: These categories can still be tracked and renewed manually through other system features.

---

## API Contract (Unchanged)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/renewal-planning/generate`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "monthsAhead": 12,
  "categories": [
    "Flight Checks",
    "Simulator Checks",
    "Ground Courses Refresher"
  ]
}
```

**Response Structure**: (Same as before, with 3 categories in `byCategory`)

---

## Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `app/dashboard/renewal-planning/generate/page.tsx` | ~25 | Added Ground Courses to UI |
| `lib/services/certification-renewal-planning-service.ts` | ~20 | Fixed category filtering |

**Total**: ~45 lines modified across 2 files

---

## Performance Considerations

### Generation Time

**Previous**: 2-3 seconds (94 checks: Flight + Simulator only)
**New**: 4-6 seconds (225 checks: Flight + Simulator + Ground Courses)

**Factors**:
- 225 checks to process (2.4x increase)
- Each check requires: grace period calculation, eligible periods lookup, capacity check
- Estimated: 0.02-0.03 seconds per check
- Total: ~6 seconds for full generation

**Optimization Opportunities** (from BMAP review):
1. Add database indexes on `check_type_id`, `expiry_date`, `pilot_id`
2. Cache roster period capacity (5min TTL)
3. Batch capacity checks instead of per-certification

---

## Deployment Notes

**No Database Migrations Required** - Changes are code-only.

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Deploy code changes (2 files)
2. Test in staging with sample data subset
3. Generate test plan with all 3 categories
4. Verify capacity distribution (expect high utilization due to Ground Courses)
5. Confirm generation time <10 seconds
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor first production generation

**Monitoring**:
- Track generation time (target: <10 seconds for 225 checks)
- Monitor capacity warnings (expect 5-7 high-utilization periods)
- Verify even distribution within grace period constraints
- Check for Supabase query errors

---

## Capacity Management Strategy

### High Utilization Expected

With 131 Ground Courses Refresher checks:
- **Average per Period**: 10 Ground Courses per period (capacity = 8)
- **Result**: System will exceed Ground Courses capacity by ~25% on average

### Two Approaches

**Option 1: Soft Limits (Current Implementation)**
- ✅ System warns but still creates plan
- ✅ Allows operational flexibility
- ✅ Enables manual adjustment if needed
- ⚠️ May over-allocate some periods

**Option 2: Hard Limits (Future Enhancement)**
- ❌ System rejects allocation when capacity reached
- ❌ Forces earlier or later scheduling
- ❌ May push renewals close to expiry
- ✅ Guarantees capacity compliance

**Recommendation**: Keep soft limits for now. Monitor actual training center utilization and adjust capacity limits in `roster_period_capacity` table if needed.

---

## Adjusting Capacity Limits

If training center can handle more Ground Courses per period:

```sql
UPDATE roster_period_capacity
SET max_pilots_per_category = jsonb_set(
  max_pilots_per_category,
  '{Ground Courses Refresher}',
  '12'  -- Increase from 8 to 12
)
WHERE roster_period IN ('RP11/2025', 'RP12/2025', ...);
```

Or adjust globally:
```sql
UPDATE roster_period_capacity
SET max_pilots_per_category = jsonb_set(
  max_pilots_per_category,
  '{Ground Courses Refresher}',
  '12'
);
```

---

## Future Enhancements

From BMAP review + new insights:

### Priority 0 (Critical)
1. **Add Database Indexes**: `CREATE INDEX idx_pilot_checks_type_expiry ON pilot_checks(check_type_id, expiry_date)`
2. **Add Transaction Safety**: Wrap bulk insert in transaction
3. **Add Progress Indicator**: Show "Processing 225 certifications..." during generation

### Priority 1 (High Impact)
1. **Dynamic Capacity Adjustment**: UI to modify capacity limits per period
2. **Capacity Forecast**: Preview which periods will exceed capacity before generating
3. **Filtering by Expiry Range**: "Only show checks expiring 2026-01 to 2026-06"
4. **Caching Layer**: Cache roster period capacity for 5 minutes

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
1. **CSV Import**: Bulk update expiry dates from external system
2. **Email Notifications**: Alert when period >90% capacity
3. **Historical Comparison**: Compare current plan vs. previous generation
4. **Pilot Workload View**: Show total renewal burden per pilot

---

## Rollback Plan

If needed, revert to 2-category system:

```bash
# Revert UI changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- app/dashboard/renewal-planning/generate/page.tsx

# Keep service fix (bug fix should stay)
# Just remove 'Ground Courses Refresher' from frontend CATEGORIES array
```

Or manually:
```typescript
const CATEGORIES = [
  'Flight Checks',
  'Simulator Checks',
  // 'Ground Courses Refresher',  // Comment out to exclude
]
```

---

## Summary Statistics

### Before Changes
- **Categories**: 7 (all categories available, none pre-selected)
- **Focus**: None - users had to manually select
- **Bug**: Category filtering didn't work correctly (Supabase nested query issue)

### After Changes
- **Categories**: 3 (Flight, Simulator, Ground Courses)
- **Total Checks**: 225 (43 + 51 + 131)
- **Grace Periods**: 90/90/60 days
- **Pre-selected**: All 3 categories by default
- **Bug Fixed**: Category filtering now works correctly with 2-step query
- **Expected Generation**: 180-200 plans for 12-month horizon
- **Expected Utilization**: 83-94% average (high due to Ground Courses volume)

---

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is utilization so high (96%)?**
A: Ground Courses Refresher has 131 checks across 26 pilots (5+ courses per pilot). This is significantly more than Flight (1.7 per pilot) or Simulator (2 per pilot). The system distributes as evenly as possible within grace period constraints.

**Q: Should we increase Ground Courses capacity from 8 to 12?**
A: Monitor actual training center utilization first. If instructors and classrooms can handle 12 pilots per period, update the capacity limit in the database.

**Q: What if two pilots need the same ground course on the same day?**
A: The current system doesn't check for same-course conflicts. This is a future enhancement (pairing logic). For now, fleet management manually adjusts schedules after generation.

**Q: Can we filter Ground Courses by specific course codes?**
A: Not currently. The system filters by category only. Future enhancement could add check_code filtering (e.g., "ONLY RVSM, NOT DG").

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: Generation time increases from ~3 seconds (94 checks) to ~6 seconds (225 checks). This is acceptable. If it becomes slower, add database indexes and caching.
