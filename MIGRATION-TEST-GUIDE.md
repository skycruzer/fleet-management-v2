## Pre-Migration Validation (IMPORTANT!)

### Step 1: Check for NULL values

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to find NULL values:

```sql
-- Check pilots table
SELECT 'pilots.first_name' as issue, COUNT(*) as count FROM pilots WHERE first_name IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pilots.last_name', COUNT(*) FROM pilots WHERE last_name IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pilots.employee_id', COUNT(*) FROM pilots WHERE employee_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pilots.role', COUNT(*) FROM pilots WHERE role IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pilot_checks.pilot_id', COUNT(*) FROM pilot_checks WHERE pilot_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pilot_checks.check_type_id', COUNT(*) FROM pilot_checks WHERE check_type_id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'leave_requests.start_date', COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests WHERE start_date IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'leave_requests.end_date', COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests WHERE end_date IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'leave_requests.days_count', COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests WHERE days_count IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'check_types.check_code', COUNT(*) FROM check_types WHERE check_code IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'an_users.email', COUNT(*) FROM an_users WHERE email IS NULL;
```

**Expected**: All counts should be 0. If any count > 0, clean that data before migration.

### Step 2: Check for duplicates

```sql
-- Check for duplicate employee IDs
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM pilots
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check for duplicate emails
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM an_users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check for duplicate check codes
SELECT check_code, COUNT(*) as count
FROM check_types
GROUP BY check_code
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check for duplicate certifications (pilot + check type)
SELECT pilot_id, check_type_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM pilot_checks
GROUP BY pilot_id, check_type_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Expected**: All queries should return 0 rows. If duplicates found, clean before migration.

### Step 3: Check for constraint violations

```sql
-- Check pilots age constraints
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
FROM pilots
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  AND (
    date_of_birth > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '18 years' OR
    date_of_birth < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '100 years'
  );

-- Check leave request date constraints
SELECT id, start_date, end_date
FROM leave_requests
WHERE end_date < start_date;

-- Check leave request days count
SELECT id, days_count
FROM leave_requests
WHERE days_count < 1 OR days_count > 365;

-- Check seniority numbers
SELECT id, seniority_number
FROM pilots
WHERE seniority_number IS NOT NULL
  AND (seniority_number < 1 OR seniority_number > 1000);
```

**Expected**: All queries should return 0 rows. If violations found, fix before migration.

## Migration Deployment Steps

### Option A: Manual Deployment (Recommended for first time)

**Step 1: Backup Database**
```bash
# Create database backup in Supabase dashboard
# Go to: Project Settings → Database → Backups → Create Backup
```

**Step 2: Apply Migrations One by One**

In Supabase SQL Editor, run migrations in this order:

1. **NOT NULL Constraints** (run entire file)
   - Copy/paste content of `20251028_add_not_null_constraints.sql`
   - Execute
   - Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'n';`

2. **Unique Constraints** (run entire file)
   - Copy/paste content of `20251028_add_unique_constraints.sql`
   - Execute
   - Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'u';`

3. **Check Constraints** (run entire file)
   - Copy/paste content of `20251028_add_check_constraints.sql`
   - Execute
   - Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'c';`

4. **Performance Indexes** (run entire file)
   - Copy/paste content of `20251028_add_performance_indexes.sql`
   - Execute
   - Verify: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public';`

**Step 3: Update Statistics**
```sql
ANALYZE pilots;
ANALYZE pilot_checks;
ANALYZE leave_requests;
ANALYZE certification_renewal_plans;
ANALYZE disciplinary_matters;
ANALYZE flight_requests;
ANALYZE feedback_posts;
ANALYZE audit_logs;
```

### Option B: Automated Deployment (After testing Option A)

```bash
# Ensure you're connected to the correct Supabase project
# Check: .env.local has correct NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

# Deploy all migrations
npm run db:deploy

# Or deploy individually
supabase db push supabase/migrations/20251028_add_not_null_constraints.sql
supabase db push supabase/migrations/20251028_add_unique_constraints.sql
supabase db push supabase/migrations/20251028_add_check_constraints.sql
supabase db push supabase/migrations/20251028_add_performance_indexes.sql
```

---

## Post-Migration Verification

### Step 1: Verify Constraints Exist

```sql
-- Count constraints by type
SELECT
  CASE contype
    WHEN 'c' THEN 'CHECK'
    WHEN 'f' THEN 'FOREIGN KEY'
    WHEN 'p' THEN 'PRIMARY KEY'
    WHEN 'u' THEN 'UNIQUE'
    WHEN 'n' THEN 'NOT NULL'
    ELSE contype::text
  END as constraint_type,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid IN (
  SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relnamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
)
GROUP BY contype
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected output should include**:
- NOT NULL: 80+
- UNIQUE: 13+
- CHECK: 45+

### Step 2: Verify Indexes Exist

```sql
-- Count indexes by table
SELECT
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as index_count
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY index_count DESC;
```

**Expected**: pilots (7+ indexes), pilot_checks (5+), leave_requests (9+), etc.

### Step 3: Verify Index Performance

```sql
-- Check that indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM pilots
WHERE role = 'Captain' AND is_active = true
ORDER BY seniority_number;
```

**Expected**: Should see "Index Scan using idx_pilots_role_seniority" in output

### Step 4: Test Critical Queries

```sql
-- Test leave eligibility query (should be fast)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.id, p.first_name, p.last_name, p.seniority_number
FROM pilots p
WHERE p.role = 'Captain'
  AND p.is_active = true
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM leave_requests lr
    WHERE lr.pilot_id = p.id
      AND lr.status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED')
      AND lr.start_date <= '2025-11-15'
      AND lr.end_date >= '2025-11-01'
  )
ORDER BY p.seniority_number;
```

**Expected**: Execution time < 50ms (was ~500ms before indexes)

---

## Regenerate TypeScript Types

After migrations are deployed successfully:

```bash
# Regenerate types from database schema
npm run db:types

# Verify types are updated
npm run type-check

# Expected: No type errors
```

**Verify**: Check `types/supabase.ts` - columns should now be non-nullable where expected

---

## Run Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm test

# Expected: All tests should pass
# If any tests fail, review and fix

# Run specific test suites
npx playwright test e2e/pilots.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/leave-requests.spec.ts
npx playwright test e2e/certifications.spec.ts
```

---

## Performance Testing

### Before Migration Baseline

Run these queries and record execution times:

```sql
-- Query 1: Dashboard metrics (before)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_pilots,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE role = 'Captain') as captains,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE role = 'First Officer') as first_officers,
  AVG(seniority_number) as avg_seniority
FROM pilots
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Query 2: Expiring certifications (before)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, ct.check_code, pc.expiry_date
FROM pilot_checks pc
JOIN pilots p ON p.id = pc.pilot_id
JOIN check_types ct ON ct.id = pc.check_type_id
WHERE pc.expiry_date IS NOT NULL
  AND pc.expiry_date <= CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND p.is_active = true
ORDER BY pc.expiry_date;

-- Query 3: Leave overlap detection (before)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pilot_id)
FROM leave_requests
WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED')
  AND start_date <= '2025-11-15'
  AND end_date >= '2025-11-01';
```

### After Migration Verification

Run same queries after migration and compare:

```sql
-- Query 1: Dashboard metrics (after)
-- Expected: 3-5x faster

-- Query 2: Expiring certifications (after)
-- Expected: 5-10x faster

-- Query 3: Leave overlap detection (after)
-- Expected: 10-20x faster (most critical improvement)
```

---

## Rollback Procedures (If Needed)

### If migration fails or issues found:

**Step 1: Restore from Backup**
```
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Go to: Project Settings → Database → Backups
# Select backup created before migration
# Click "Restore"
```

**Step 2: Or Manual Rollback**

```sql
-- Drop indexes first (fastest rollback)
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_pilots_role;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_pilots_seniority_number;
-- ... (drop all indexes created)

-- Then drop constraints
ALTER TABLE pilots DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS chk_pilots_date_of_birth_valid;
ALTER TABLE pilots DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS uk_pilots_employee_id;
-- ... (drop all constraints created)

-- Finally remove NOT NULL constraints
ALTER TABLE pilots ALTER COLUMN first_name DROP NOT NULL;
-- ... (remove all NOT NULL constraints)
```

**Recovery Time**: 5-10 minutes

## Monitoring Checklist

After deployment, monitor for 24 hours:

- [ ] Database CPU usage (should decrease)
- [ ] Database memory usage (should stay similar)
- [ ] Query execution times (should decrease)
- [ ] Application error rates (should stay same or decrease)
- [ ] API response times (should decrease)
- [ ] Dashboard load times (should decrease 40-50%)
- [ ] User-reported issues (should be zero)

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Migration fails with "violates constraint"

**Cause**: Existing data violates new constraint
**Solution**: Run pre-migration validation queries, clean data, try again

### Issue 2: "permission denied" error

**Cause**: Insufficient database permissions
**Solution**: Ensure using service role key with admin permissions

### Issue 3: Indexes not being used

**Cause**: Query planner statistics outdated
**Solution**: Run `ANALYZE` on all modified tables

### Issue 4: Application errors after migration

**Cause**: TypeScript types not regenerated
**Solution**: Run `npm run db:types` and `npm run type-check`

### Issue 5: Tests failing after migration

**Cause**: Tests may insert invalid data (now blocked by constraints)
**Solution**: Update test data to meet new constraints

---

## Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:

✅ All 4 migrations deployed without errors
✅ All constraints exist (verify with SQL queries)
✅ All indexes exist (verify with SQL queries)
✅ TypeScript types regenerated successfully
✅ All type checks pass
✅ All E2E tests pass
✅ Dashboard loads 40-50% faster
✅ API responses 20-30% faster
✅ No increase in error rates
✅ Zero user-reported issues after 24 hours

---

## Support & Escalation

If issues encountered during migration:

1. **Check validation queries** - Did we miss existing data violations?
2. **Check rollback procedures** - Can we safely rollback?
3. **Check backup availability** - Is recent backup available?
4. **Escalate to Maurice** - If critical issue blocking production

---

## Next Steps After Successful Migration

1. ✅ Mark Sprint 1 Days 1-2 as complete
2. ✅ Update project health score (75/100 → 78/100 expected)
3. ✅ Begin Days 3-4: Security Hardening
4. ✅ Implement CSRF protection
5. ✅ Add rate limiting
6. ✅ Remove sensitive logging
7. ✅ Audit RLS policies
