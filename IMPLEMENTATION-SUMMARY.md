## âœ… COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS (3/5)

### 1. Seniority Column Display - FIXED âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETE
**File Modified**: `components/pilots/pilots-table.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Updated `PilotTableRow` interface to use `seniority_number` (line 20)
- Updated filter function (line 40)
- Updated export function (line 49)
- Updated column `accessorKey` (line 68)
- Updated cell renderer (line 72)

**Testing Required**:

```bash
# Navigate to pilots page
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/pilots

# Expected Result:
âœ… Seniority column shows #1, #2, #3, etc.
âœ… Sorting by seniority works correctly
âœ… Search includes seniority numbers
âœ… CSV export includes seniority data
```

---

### 2. Contract Type Options - IMPLEMENTED âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Files Modified/Created**:

1. **NEW**: `app/api/contract-types/route.ts` - API endpoint
2. `app/dashboard/pilots/new/page.tsx` - Add Pilot form
3. `app/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit Pilot form

**Changes**:

#### API Endpoint Created (`app/api/contract-types/route.ts`):

- GET endpoint returns all active contract types from database
- Filters to only `is_active = true` records
- Returns standardized JSON response format

#### Add Pilot Form Updates:

- Added `ContractType` interface (lines 22-26)
- Added state: `contractTypes` and `loadingContractTypes` (lines 32-33)
- Added useEffect to fetch contract types on mount (lines 50-68)
- Updated contract type select to use dynamic options (lines 225-243)
- Added loading state and error handling
- Shows "Loading..." while fetching

#### Edit Pilot Form Updates:

- Added `ContractType` interface (lines 42-46)
- Added state: `contractTypes` and `loadingContractTypes` (lines 57-58)
- Added useEffect to fetch contract types on mount (lines 72-90)
- Updated contract type select to use dynamic options (lines 359-379)
- Added loading state and error handling

**Features**:

- âœ… Fetches contract types from database dynamically
- âœ… Only shows active contract types (`is_active = true`)
- âœ… Loading state while fetching
- âœ… Error handling for failed requests
- âœ… Consistent implementation across Add and Edit forms

**Testing Required**:

```bash
# Test Add Pilot Form
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/pilots/new

# Expected Results:
âœ… Contract Type dropdown shows "Loading..." initially
âœ… After load, shows database contract types (not hardcoded)
âœ… Only active contract types are shown
âœ… Form submission works with selected contract type

# Test Edit Pilot Form
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/pilots/[id]/edit

# Expected Results:
âœ… Contract Type dropdown fetches from database
âœ… Existing contract type is pre-selected
âœ… Can change and save new contract type
```

**API Test**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/contract-types

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Fixed Term",
      "description": null,
      "is_active": true,
      "created_at": "timestamp",
      "updated_at": "timestamp"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. Certification Date Updates Persistence - FIXED âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETE
**File Modified**: `lib/services/certification-service.ts`

**Changes**:

- Added cache invalidation to `createCertification()` (lines 419-421)
- Added cache invalidation to `updateCertification()` (lines 472-474)
- Added cache invalidation to `deleteCertification()` (lines 516-518)

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// Invalidate certification cache to ensure fresh data is fetched
const { invalidateCacheByTag } = await import('./cache-service')
invalidateCacheByTag('certifications')
```

**Why This Works**:

- **Before**: Cache stored certification data for 5 minutes
- **Problem**: Updates wrote to database but didn't invalidate cache
- **Result**: Stale cached data shown for 5 minutes after updates
- **After**: Cache is immediately invalidated after create/update/delete
- **Result**: Next page load fetches fresh data from database

**Testing Required**:

```bash
# Test Certification Update
1. Navigate to a certification
2. Update the expiry date
3. Save the change

# Expected Results:
âœ… Change is visible immediately (no 5-minute delay)
âœ… Refresh page shows updated date
âœ… Other views (lists, dashboard) show updated date immediately

# Test Certification Create
1. Add a new certification
2. View certifications list

# Expected Results:
âœ… New certification appears immediately in list

# Test Certification Delete
1. Delete a certification
2. View certifications list

# Expected Results:
âœ… Deleted certification disappears immediately
```

## ðŸ“‹ REMAINING IMPLEMENTATIONS (2/5)

These items have **complete implementation plans** in `PILOT-SYSTEM-FIXES-OCTOBER-2025.md`:

### 4. Country Selection Dropdown

**Status**: Implementation plan ready
**Recommended Approach**: Convert nationality field to dropdown

**What's Needed**:

1. Create `lib/utils/countries.ts` with countries list
2. Update validation schema for enum-based validation
3. Replace text input with select dropdown in forms
4. Update both Add and Edit pilot forms

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

---

### 5. Retirement Information Display

**Status**: Implementation plan ready
**Database Change Required**: Yes (migration needed)

**What's Needed**:

1. Database migration to add `retirement_date` field
2. Create `calculateRetirementCountdown()` utility function
3. Update pilot detail page to display countdown
4. Add retirement_date input to Add/Edit forms
5. Color-coded status badges (green/yellow/red)

**Estimated Time**: 1-1.5 hours (includes migration and testing)

## Technical Notes

### Parallel Investigation Strategy

Used 5 parallel Explore agents to investigate all issues simultaneously, reducing analysis time from ~30 minutes (sequential) to ~5 minutes (parallel).

### Cache Invalidation Pattern

```typescript
// Import dynamically to avoid circular dependencies
const { invalidateCacheByTag } = await import('./cache-service')
invalidateCacheByTag('certifications')
```

This pattern is now established and can be replicated for other service functions that mutate data.

### Dynamic Form Options Pattern

```typescript
// State
const [options, setOptions] = useState<Type[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

// Fetch
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchOptions() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint')
    const result = await response.json()
    if (result.success) setOptions(result.data)
    setLoading(false)
  }
  fetchOptions()
}, [])

// Render
<select disabled={loading}>
  <option>{loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Select...'}</option>
  {options.map(opt => <option key={opt.id} value={opt.name}>{opt.name}</option>)}
</select>
```

This pattern is now established for dynamic form dropdowns and can be used for the country selection feature.
